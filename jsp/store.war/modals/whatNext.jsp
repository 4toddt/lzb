		<p class="text-msg">
			We make special order furniture specifically for you and your home. Once your order is placed online, you will receive a swatch of the cover(s) you have chosen and the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries closest to you will call to discuss your order. You may change or cancel your order within this period at any time. Once you and your local store confirm your order, your local store will process the order and your credit card will be charged a non-refundable 50% deposit plus any after treatments. After the deposit is charged, you may not cancel or change your order or obtain a refund. Your credit card will be charged the balance of your order when delivery is scheduled, at this time your local La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries will call you to setup delivery.
