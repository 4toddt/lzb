    <h1>La-Z-Boy Reports Solid Fiscal 2021 Third-quarter Results</h1>
    <h2>Strong Written Orders Drive Record Backlog Quarterly Dividend Increased </h2>
    <div class="copy">
        <p><strong>Monroe, MI (February 16, 2021)</strong> – <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in residential furniture, today reported strong operating results for the fiscal 2021 third quarter ended January
            23, 2021.</p>
        <h3>Fiscal 2021 third quarter versus Fiscal 2020 third quarter:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Consolidated sales decreased 1.2% to $470.2 million</li>
            <li>Written same-store sales for the entire <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries® network increased 6.3%, with strong acceleration in January</li>
            <li>Consolidated operating margin:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>GAAP: 7.3% versus 11.0%</li>
                <li>Non-GAAP(1): 9.5% versus 9.4%</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wholesale(2): 10.2% versus 11.1%</li>
                    <li>Retail: 8.9% versus 9.8%</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Net income attributable to <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated per diluted share (“EPS”):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>GAAP: $0.62 versus $0.74</li>
                <li>Non-GAAP(1): $0.74 versus $0.72</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Strong cash generation, with fiscal year-to-date cash from operating activities of $250 million</li>
            <li>Cash(3) more than doubled to $393 million at quarter end</li>
            <li>The company returned $7.4 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kurt L. Darrow, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>, said, "Robust written trends continue across all <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated businesses as consumer demand for home
            furnishings remains unabated. However, delivered sales declined slightly versus last year's record third quarter due to greater-than-anticipated impacts from COVID-19 across our supply chain. We continue to add additional capacity to service
            our unprecedented order rate, with our supply chain team actively ramping production as quickly as possible to service customers while prioritizing the health and safety of employees. Even with these short-term challenges, we delivered a strong
            consolidated operating margin, including another profitable quarter for Joybird. We also continued to generate strong cash from operations and declared an increased dividend of $0.15 per share. We are well positioned to deliver continued solid
            financial results."</p>
        <p>Consolidated sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 decreased 1.2% to $470.2 million versus the fiscal 2020 record third quarter, affected by temporary supply chain impacts from COVID-19. Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 7.3% versus 11.0%
            in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated non-GAAP(1) operating margin improved to 9.5% versus 9.4% in last year’s third quarter, primarily driven by strong performance by Joybird.</p>
        <p>For the entire <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries® network, written same-store sales increased 6.3% for the fiscal 2021 third quarter compared with the fiscal 2020 third quarter. Stripping out Canadian stores that were closed
            at various points during the quarter due to COVID-19 restrictions, written same-store sales increased 8.2% for the network. Strong momentum in January brought fiscal 2021 year-to-date written same-store sales for the network to 18% versus
            the prior-year period.</p>
        <p>For the fiscal 2021 third quarter, delivered sales in the company’s Wholesale(2) segment decreased 3.9% to $350.7 million compared with the prior-year quarter. While significant demand has led to a record-level backlog, COVID-19-related issues,
            including plant absenteeism and shipping delays, hampered the company's ability to increase production and delivery at planned rates and also impacted product mix. Non-GAAP(1) operating margin for the Wholesale(2) segment was 10.2% versus
            11.1% for the prior-year period, primarily reflecting COVID-19-related impacts on our supply chain and increased costs to expand manufacturing capacity, partially offset by lower promotional activity in the strong demand environment.</p>
        <p>Retail segment delivered sales decreased 0.9% to $166.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, reflecting COVID-19-related product delays. Written same-store sales for the company-owned <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries®
            stores increased 9.1% in the quarter, with strong momentum in January, reflecting positive trends across all sales metrics, including traffic, conversion and average ticket. Non-GAAP(1) operating margin for the Retail segment was 8.9% versus
            9.8% in last year’s third quarter, primarily related to lower delivered sales relative to fixed costs and higher selling expenses driven by commissions paid on increased written sales, partially offset by decreased spending for marketing given
            robust demand and decreased travel expenses.</p>
        <p>Within Corporate & Other, Joybird sales increased 30% to $28.6 million. Written sales increased 79% compared with the prior-year quarter, reflecting ongoing strong order trends and the strength of the brand in the online marketplace. Joybird again
            delivered profitable growth, improving its gross margin and investing in marketing to drive customer acquisition.</p>
        <p>GAAP diluted EPS was $0.62 for the fiscal 2021 third quarter versus $0.74 in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP(1) diluted EPS was $0.74 versus $0.72 in last year’s third quarter.</p>
        <h3>Balance Sheet and Cash Flow</h3>
        <p>Year to date, the company generated $250 million in cash from operating activities, reflecting strong profit performance and a $122 million increase in customer deposits from written orders for the company's Retail segment and Joybird. <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>            ended the period with $393 million in cash(3), compared with $168 million in cash(3) at the end of the fiscal 2020 third quarter. The company holds $31 million in investments to enhance returns on cash versus $30 million at the end of last
            year's period. Year to date, the company invested $8 million in acquisitions, $27 million in the business through capital expenditures, paid $10 million in dividends and spent $0.9 million purchasing approximately 22 thousand shares of stock
            in the open market under its existing authorized share repurchase program, leaving 4.5 million shares available for repurchase under the program as of January 23, 2021.</p>
        <h3>Dividend</h3>
        <p>On February 16, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the company's common stock of $0.15 per share, an increase of 7%. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2021.</p>
        <h3>Business Outlook</h3>
        <p>Due to the unusual business trends driven by the pandemic, <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> is updating the perspective previously provided for the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. The company does not intend to provide this level of forward-looking
            perspective regularly.</p>
        <p>Given the continued temporary impacts of COVID-19 on the company’s manufacturing facilities and broader supply chain, and comparing with a prior-year base period which included the month-long pandemic shutdown, <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>            now expects fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter consolidated sales growth of 34% to 39% versus the prior-year quarter, and consolidated non-GAAP operating margin at the lower end of the 9% to 11% range.</p>
        <em>
            <h4><sup>(1)</sup>Non-GAAP amounts for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 exclude:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>purchase accounting charges related to acquisitions totaling $10.4 million pre-tax, or $0.20 per diluted share, primarily due to a write-up of the Joybird contingent consideration liability based on forecasted future performance, with $10.3 million included in operating income and $0.1 million included in interest expense</li>
                <li>income of $5.2 million pre-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, related to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") recorded in other income related to the impact of employee retention credits</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Non-GAAP amounts for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 exclude:</h4>

            <p><strong><sup>(2)</sup>Wholesale segment:</strong> Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, in order to better align with the manner in which we view and manage the business, coupled with economic and customer channel similarities, the company revised its reportable operating segments by aggregating the former Upholstery segment with the former Casegoods segment to form the newly combined Wholesale segment. The change in reportable operating segments reflects how the company evaluates financial information used to make operating decisions. Prior-period results disclosed in this earnings release with respect to the Wholesale segment have been revised to reflect these changes.</p>

        <h3>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h3>
        <p>In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), this press release also includes Non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures
            when assessing our ongoing performance. This press release contains references to Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income attributable to <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>            Incorporated and Non-GAAP net income attributable to <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated per diluted share, which may exclude, as applicable, business realignment charges, purchase accounting charges, charges for our supply chain
            optimization initiative, benefits from the CARES Act, and refunds related to terminating the company's defined benefit pension plan. The business realignment charges include severance costs, asset impairment costs, and costs to relocate equipment
            and inventory related to organizational changes we undertook as a result of our COVID-19 Action Plan. The purchase accounting charges may include the amortization of intangible assets, incremental expense upon the sale of inventory acquired
            at fair value, amortization of employee retention agreements, fair value adjustments of future cash payments recorded as interest expense, and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration. The charges for our supply chain optimization
            initiative may include severance costs, accelerated depreciation expense, costs to relocate equipment and inventory, as well as other costs related to the closure, relocation and sale of certain manufacturing operations. The benefits from
            the CARES Act include the impact of employee retention credits. In addition, the “Business Outlook” section of this press release references the Non-GAAP financial measure of “Non-GAAP operating margin” for a future period. Non-GAAP operating
            margin may exclude items such as pre-tax purchase accounting charges and pre-tax business realignment charges. These and other not presently determinable items could have a material impact on the determination of operating margin on a GAAP
            basis and as not available at this time without unreasonable efforts, we have not provided a reference to GAAP operating margin or a reconciliation to non-GAAP operating margin for future periods in this press release. These Non-GAAP financial
            measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported
            by other companies. Reconciliations of such Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables.</p>
        <p>Management believes that presenting certain Non-GAAP financial measures will help investors understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. Management excludes
            purchase accounting charges because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions consummated and the success with which we operate the businesses acquired. While
            the company has a history of acquisition activity, it does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the impact of purchase accounting charges is unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition.
            Similarly, business realignment charges and the charges related to the company’s supply chain optimization initiative are dependent on the timing, size, number and nature of the operations being moved or closed, and the charges may not be
            incurred on a predictable cycle. Management also excludes benefits from the CARES Act and refunds related to the termination of the company's defined benefit pension plan when assessing the company's operating and financial performance due
            to the one-time nature of these transactions. Management believes that exclusion of these items facilitates more consistent comparisons of the company’s operating results over time. Where applicable, the accompanying “Reconciliation of GAAP
            to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables present the excluded items net of tax calculated using the effective tax rate from operations for the period in which the adjustment is presented, except for the non-tax deductible adjustment to the fair
            value of contingent consideration which reflects the associated GAAP tax impact in the period presented.</p>
