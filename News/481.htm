        <p>MONROE, MICH., (May 1, 2015) - Kurt Darrow, chairman, president and chief executive officer of <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Inc. was recently awarded the City of Hope Spirit of Life Award. Darrow received the prestigious award along with Clarence Smith, chief executive officer and president of Havertys. Together, the team raised a record-breaking $1.6 million to benefit lifesaving research for City of Hope, a Duarte, Calif.-based cancer and diabetes research and treatment center.</p>

<p>The Spirit of Life Award, the City of Hope's highest honor, was presented on April 19 in High Point, North Carolina during a gala event attended by more than 800 furniture industry executives to celebrate the industry's 50<sup>th</sup> year of support for the non-profit organization. Over the past 50 years, the industry has collectively raised a total of $55 million for cancer and diabetes research.</p>

<p>"It is a tremendous honor to receive the Spirit of Life Award from City of Hope," Darrow said. "The worldwide impact that City of Hope's scientists and doctors have in their fight against cancer and other life-threatening diseases is remarkable. As an industry, our role is to try and make sure that resources are not the issue. City of Hope relies on our support to make what they do possible, and I'm privileged to play a small part in helping making that happen."</p>

<p>Darrow has been president and CEO of <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> since 2003, and chairman since 2011. During his 35 years with the company, it grew from one known primarily for its reclining chairs into one of the world's leading residential home furnishings producers and retailers, manufacturing furniture for every room in the home. Within the furniture industry, Darrow has held numerous prominent roles in the industry, including chairman of the American Home Furnishings Alliance (AHFA) and board president of The American Furniture Hall of Fame Foundation.</p>

<p>He is a member of the Board of Directors for CMS Energy Corp., and sits on the Board and Executive Committee of Business Leaders for Michigan. Darrow also serves as both a member of the ProMedica Board of Trustees, as well as Chairman of the ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Michigan, he holds a bachelors of arts degree in business administration and an honorary doctorate from Adrian College, and is a past member of its board of trustees.</p>
