    <h1>La-Z-Boy Announces Kurt Darrow to Retire as Ceo; Will Remain Chairman of the Board</h1>
    <h2>CFO Melinda Whittington to Succeed Darrow as CEO</h2>
    <div class="copy">
        <p><strong>Monroe, MI (February 16, 2021)</strong> – <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in residential furniture, today announced that Kurt L. Darrow will retire from his positions as President and Chief
            Executive Officer (“CEO”) on April 25, 2021, after more than 40 years of service to the company. His retirement follows the end of <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy’s</span> fiscal 2021 year. He will remain Chairman of the Board of Directors,
            in a non-executive capacity.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the company’s long-standing commitment to thoughtful succession planning, Melinda D. Whittington, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), was unanimously appointed by the Board to serve as President and CEO of <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>            Incorporated. Robert (“Bob”) G. Lucian, Vice President, Finance, will succeed Whittington in the role of CFO. In addition, Whittington was elected to serve on the Board of Directors, effective April 25, 2021.</p>
        <p>Darrow stated, “It has been an extraordinary honor to serve as <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy’s</span> President and CEO for the past 17 years, as well as Chairman of the Board since 2011. I have had the opportunity to watch and be part of this
            company’s evolution from a manufacturer of a single product, the iconic <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> recliner, to become the second-largest provider of residential furniture in the U.S., with a growing and vibrant <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>            Furniture Galleries® retail network. As a team, we have delivered long-term profitable growth in a dynamic industry, which has weathered monumental change. I am proud of every employee across our organization, all of whom have and continue
            to contribute to our success, and it has been a motivating and gratifying privilege to work with them while honoring the legacy of our founders and the values they instilled upon our company and culture.”</p>
        <p>Darrow added, “On behalf of our Board of Directors, it is with great pleasure that we appoint Melinda as our next CEO. Her more than 30 years’ experience, including extensive consumer products expertise, proven capability in operational and financial
            matters, strategic vision and sharp focus, will guide the company forward as the landscape for home furnishings continues to evolve. It is the right time for Melinda to take the helm. Her strategic acumen and demonstrated leadership skills
            position her to successfully lead <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> to and through its next chapter of growth. The company is in excellent shape and, as I step away from the day-to-day operations, I have every confidence Melinda and our
            top-tier leadership team will leverage the many opportunities that lie ahead for <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>.” </p>
        <p>W. Alan McCollough, Lead Director of the Board, said: “Kurt has made a significant impact on <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated. During his tenure as CEO, he strengthened the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> brand, honed the
            company’s portfolio, championed and evolved the company’s integrated-retail strategy and entered the company into the e-commerce arena. Kurt’s vision for the future helped transform <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy’s</span> global supply chain
            into a value-creating asset and set the company on a course for continued growth and profitability. Kurt led the company through two of the most challenging times in its history, the Great Recession and, more recently, through uncharted territory
            resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> was fortunate to have a CEO of his caliber. On behalf of the Board and the entire <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> organization, I thank him for his many
            contributions to the company and look forward to his continued leadership of our Board.”</p>
        <p>Whittington said, “I am honored by the opportunity to lead <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>, with its rich and storied 94-year history and iconic brand. We have a solid platform from which to grow and prosper and a bright future ahead. Our
            team is proven, passionate and skilled, and we will capitalize on opportunities for future growth and innovation, including the build out of our omnichannel presence while we help consumers turn their houses into homes. I would like to thank
            Kurt and the Board for placing their trust and confidence in me as I move into the CEO role and lead a company made up of people with extraordinary talent and dedication.”
            <p>Whittington added, “I look forward to working with Bob as our new CFO. With his strong financial expertise and business acumen, including more than three decades of experience at The Procter and Gamble Company (P&G), he will seamlessly move
                into the CFO role. During his last two years as <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy’s</span> VP, Finance, he brought meaningful improvement to the organization’s finance processes and business decision making. I’m confident he will continue
                to provide financial and business leadership as our CFO.”</p>
