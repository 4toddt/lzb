    <h1>Revolutionary New Duo by La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy Furniture Bridges Style and Comfort</h1>
    <div class="copy">
        <img src="http://content.la-z-boy.com/News/Images/2017-04-21.png">
        <p><strong>High Point, NC (April 21, 2017)</strong> – La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy announced today the release of Duo, a revolutionary new
            product line that features the sophisticated look of stationary furniture with the unexpected power to recline
            at the push of a button.</p>
        <p>“When developing Duo, our goal was to bring the great look of a stationary sofa together with the comfort of a motion
            piece,” said Gregg Schweir, vice president of research and development for La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy. “Today, most reclining furniture
            has a distinct look, and we rose above that stereotype by creating a beautiful reclining sofa that was not limited
            by styling options.”</p>
        <p>When it comes to designing the perfect room, it’s all about the details. Duo can be placed anywhere in a room, even
            up against a wall. Patented ComfortCore® cushions bring added comfort, and the optional battery pack provides
            power for days - making it possible for Duo to float anywhere in the room without cords. The footrest itself
            rotates front and back, ergonomically adjusting based on a person’s height. In addition, Duo sofas and loveseats
            have a smooth upholstered outside back without spilt lines or seams – typically visible on reclining pieces.</p>
        <p>“For a couple designing the perfect room, there was always a compromise between style and function – especially in
            small spaces,” said Paula Hoyas, vice president of merchandising for La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy. “Customers can now get exactly
            what they want without having to decide between design and comfort – it’s a perfect match. Duo represents a new
            look in reclining comfort.”
        </p>
        <p>The line is proudly built in the United States and includes standard USB ports on every piece of furniture, including
            a sectional, sofas, loveseats, and chairs. Duo will initially include four styles that are available in multiple
            pieces, each of which is fully customizable in more than 900 fabrics and leathers and a range of comfort and
            styling options.
        </p>
        <p>Duo will be available in La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy Furniture Galleries retail locations this fall.</p>
