MONROE, MI. (May 9, 2013) – <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> recognized the owners and operators of its top performing <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries locations at an awards ceremony held during the recent High Point Furniture Market. 
</p>
<p>
“Once a year, we take the opportunity to reflect on the great 
achievements of our stores and applaud them for their commitment to the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> brand,” said Mark Bacon, president of <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Branded Business. “Their hard-work and dedication helps solidify our position as the most recognized home furnishings brand.”
</p>
<p>
Today, the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries network consists of 316 stores located throughout the United States and Canada. 
</p>
<h2>Retail Partner of the Year</h2>
<p>
The Retail Partner of the Year award recognizes one owner in the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries retail system that continuously demonstrates a commitment to the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> brand, retail network and customers. This honor was given to Ed Breunig, III, owner and operator of nine <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>
 Furniture Galleries across Arizona. Breunig’s team has been the pioneer
 for many of the company’s successful programs including free in-home 
design and the case goods expansion. 
</p>
<p>
He continues to grow his business year after year by becoming more 
efficient and consistently identifying, addressing and exceeding his 
customer’s needs. In fact, the Breunig organization was named one of the
 top 100 furniture retailers in the United States.  
</p>
<p>
“We are honored to have the Breunig team as part of the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>
 family,” said Bacon. “Their ongoing commitment to the brand, their 
business and the consumer is unparalleled, which is why they continue to
 grow year over year.” 
</p>
<h2>Top New Dealer</h2>
<p>
This award recognizes a new store owner that has gone above and beyond to embrace the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>
 brand and has demonstrated retail success. The recipients of the Top 
New Dealer award for 2012 are Chris and Lisa Washko, who currently 
operate four <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries across the Seattle market. 
</p>
<h2>Customer Service Excellence</h2>
<p>
The Customer Service Excellence award was given to Dave Layman and the 
Springdale, Arkansas team for achieving the highest level of customer 
satisfaction in the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture 
Galleries system across North America. This is the second consecutive 
year for that the team has achieved this recognition. 
</p>
<h2>Ronald McDonald House Charities® Partner of the Year</h2>
<p>
The Ronald McDonald House Charities® (RMHC) Partner of the Year award recognizes the partner in the <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>
 Furniture Galleries retail system who has continuously demonstrated 
commitment to the RMHC partnership. This honor was given to Michael 
DeNisco, II for his efforts to support the non-profit organization. 
</p>
<p>
When a new 25-bedroom Ronald McDonald house was being built, DeNisco 
stepped in offering design expertise and provided over $10,000 in 
furniture to help make the House a home. He also offered a store 
promotion in conjunction with the House opening and donated a percentage
 of sales back to RMHC. His family is an active volunteer at the House 
and DeNisco can often be found preparing dinners for its guests. 
</p>
<p>
“Michael is a testament of our commitment to providing comfort to 
families at a time when they need it most,” said Bacon. “We applaud him 
for his passion towards the cause and for the inspiration he gives to 
others. 
</p>
<p>
DeNisco operates three <span class="nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries across New York.
