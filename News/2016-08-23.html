    <h1>La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy Announces New iClean Stain-Repelling Fabric</h1>
    <p class="subheading">Advanced fabric technology provides a barrier of protection from everyday spills</p>
    <div class="copy">
        <img src="http://content.la-z-boy.com/News/Images/2016-09-08.jpg">
        <p><strong>Monroe, Mich. (August 23, 2016)</strong> – La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy is excited to introduce iClean, its new and
            innovative stain-repelling fabric. iClean is a high-performance fabric that incorporates safe, sophisticated
            chemistry to protect and surround each fiber, repelling spills before they turn into stains. Everyday spills
            are now protected with iClean, including coffee, wine, salsa, dirt, chocolate and more.</p>
        <p>So how does it work? iClean fabrics are completely immersed in a stain resistant solution assuring every single fiber
            has been treated. This process leaves a concentrated barrier of protection while still keeping the touch soft
            and luxurious. </p>
        <p>“At La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy, we want our customers to discover quality products that work with their life,” said Paula
            Hoyas, Vice President Merchandising, La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy. “iClean represents a leap forward in a new generation
            of high-performance fabrics as we continually strive to develop solutions that enhance consumer’s lives.”</p>
        <p>iClean fabric creates a barrier of protection from stains associated with children, pets and everyday life. Hoyas
            added, “No longer do parents need to postpone owning that beautiful sofa until kids grow or move out.” For most
            liquid spills, the fabric can be cleaned by simply blotting the spill with a paper towel. iClean fabrics are
            available in 45 base cloths and 18 correlates and can be ordered on most La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy frames. The fabric
            also includes a three-year limited warranty. </p>
        <p>“Our tag line is ‘Live Life Comfortably’ and iClean will help consumers do that by reducing fear of stains,” said
            Hoyas. “This advanced fabric technology gives consumers a better choice for their homes and everyday living.”</p>
