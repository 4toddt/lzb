							<p>D.C., (Dec. 14, 2015) - La-Z-Boy recently introduced its first-ever urban, small footprint store to the Logan Circle community, located at 1328 14th Street in Washington D.C. The store features the company’s sleek and contemporary Urban Attitudes collection, beautiful stationary pieces, modern motion pieces, accessories to complete the full look and a fabric wall that shows the full range of customization options available to customers.</p>

							<p>The boutique-style store, which occupies just over 3,000-square-feet, boasts a remarkable selection of great looking furniture for the entire home, and will provide customers an evolved La-Z-Boy brand experience in-store that is different than any other location.</p>

							<p>“This store is the first of its kind for La-Z-Boy, and we’re thrilled to open it in the heart of Washington, D.C.,” said Mark Bacon, President La-Z-Boy Branded Business. “While the store definitely brings an urban flair, it was designed to appeal to a wide range of La-Z-Boy customers. We encourage residents to come in and take a look – I know they will be surprised by what we have to offer.”</p>

							<p>
								<strong><u>No Pressure Shopping</u></strong><br />
								The new format store also offers two convenient approaches for shoppers who seek design direction.  Customers looking to visualize their custom furniture dreams can use interactive design tools to render any La-Z-Boy product in their choice of hundreds of fabric and leather covers.  For those who need more inspiration and guidance, La-Z-Boy also offers free In-Home Design Assistance from professionals experienced at helping turn design dreams into reality. La-Z-Boy designers will visit customer’s homes to help them with their design project and advise on styles that will fit comfortably into their home and budget.
							</p>

							<p>“Our associates provide a comfortable shopping environment from selection through delivery,” said Bacon.  “Consumers can be assured that they will enjoy a comfortable no-pressure experience while at our stores – we’re truly here to help.”</p>

							<p>The Logan Circle store opened its doors in late November.</p>
