    <h1>La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy Celebrates 90 Years of American Made Comfort</h1>
    <p><strong>Monroe, Mich. (March 24, 2017)</strong> – La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy is celebrating its milestone 90th anniversary today with more than 6,300 employees nationwide, spanning its corporate headquarters in Michigan, five U.S. manufacturing plants,
        six U.S. distribution centers, and 142 corporate-owned La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy Furniture Galleries® stores (an additional 204 store locations are dealer owned).</p>
    <p>Ninety years ago, cousins Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker built a game-changing piece of furniture in Monroe, Mich., with the goal of providing lasting comfort. Their hard work evolved into a true American success story and a brand that
        has become a household name.</p>
    <p>“Since the very first day, La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy has had a clear focus on building comfortable, great-looking furniture with a focus on quality,” said Kurt Darrow, Chairman, President and CEO, of La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy, Incorporated. “While our brand
        has continued to evolve and our products have become more innovative and design focused, our commitment to our customers has remained steadfast.”</p>
    <p>Most recently, the company demonstrated its commitment to innovation with the announcement of a $26 million investment in its largest manufacturing facility in Dayton, Tenn. This investment includes the construction of a new, state-of-the-art Innovation
        Center that will house a model shop, technology center, test lab and three-dimensional printing lab.</p>
    <p>Currently, La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy has 246 issued and active patents in the United States and internationally, serving as a testament to its commitment to innovation, research and development.</p>
    <p>La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy has been at the forefront of offering products that meet the needs of its customers. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Innovative fabric options such as iClean, a high-performance stain-repelling fabric that helps prevent spills from turning into stains;</li>
        <li>Urban Attitudes, a collection designed to complement smaller spaces that includes an eclectic mix of sofas and chairs;</li>
        <li>Partnering with industry leaders to offer the best in power recline functionality and technology enhancements including rechargeable battery packs, USB charging stations and more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The company continues to innovate its retail experience both online and off. It recently launched a newly redesigned desktop and mobile website, created to offer consumers a more dynamic and intuitive digital experience. In recent years, La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy
        also redefined its retail concept, offering consumers an award-winning design plan that highlights style and inspirations, reinforces the company’s brand proposition and celebrate its depth of product offering beyond the iconic chair. From free
        design services to a full range of accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products under the brand names American Drew, Hammary and Kincaid, customers can find everything they need to truly transform their houses into homes.</p>
    <p>“Our innovative spirit started 90 years ago with a focus on comfort,” said Darrow. “We’re proud of our past, and today La&#8209;Z&#8209;Boy is focused on the future and committed to moving our brand forward.”</p>
