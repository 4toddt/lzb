            <h2>Commonly Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is the warranty timeline?</h3>
                <p>The warranty for your specific chair is based on the year your item was purchased. Please note that proof of purchase is required for validation of warranty. The current warranty for seating is: one year for cushions and parts. For specific
                    inquiries, please contact our Customer Care&nbsp;department.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>How do I attach the top of the chair to the gas lift?</h3>
                <p>The gas lift is inserted in the hole located behind the tension knob on the seat plate. The gas lift does not fit inside the tension&nbsp;knob.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is the weight limit on my chair?</h3>
                <p>All of our chairs have been tested to meet the rigorous standards of the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer&rsquo;s Association (BIFMA). Our chairs have a weight limit of up to 250 lbs., unless stated otherwise. Please refer
                    to your warranty sheet for the weight limit on your&nbsp;chair.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Can I get the back cushion to come forward?</h3>
                <p>Our chairs are designed to tilt backwards, but the back cushion will not move forward. Once the chair is in the upright position, the back will not come any further&nbsp;forward.</p>
            </div>
            <a id="view-more" onclick="this.parentNode.removeChild(this);">View more</a>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Am I supposed to keep the spacer on my chair?</h3>
                <p>Yes, please do not remove the spacer. Spacers keep the front of the chair from tilting downward. There should only be one spacer positioned on the bottom of the seat cushion. Not all chairs require a spacer for assembly, check your assembly
                    instructions if you are&nbsp;unsure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>How do I register my warranty?</h3>
                <p>You do not need to register your warranty. Your warranty time period is validated by the purchase date on your original purchase receipt. (Please note that the warranty cannot be validated without your original purchase&nbsp;receipt.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is bonded leather?</h3>
                <p>Bonded leather is a manufactured leather-fiber material with specific properties that make it look like leather. Bonded leather is manufactured using genuine leather remnants from factories and tanneries. Recycling these remnants represents
                    an important contribution to the conservation of natural resources and as a result, bonded leather is referred to as an environmentally friendly&nbsp;material.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>How do I get my chair to tilt?</h3>
                <p>If you are sitting in your chair and it is &ldquo;locked,&rdquo; please follow these steps. If your seat plate has one handle: Step one: sit in the chair, and grasp the handle with your right hand. Pull the handle away from the chair (it
                    will come out about an inch) and recline. Step two: If the chair is unlocked, but is still not reclining, reach under the seat cushion, and turn the knob to the right to loosen the tension. This should allow your chair to lean back.
                    If your seat plate has two handles: Step one: make sure the handle on the left is pulled out away from the chair (it will come out about an inch). Try to lean back. If this does not solve the problem, please follow step two&nbsp;above.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>How should the chair be cleaned?</h3>
                <p>While we do not recommend a particular cleaning product, you can use a damp cloth to wipe down your chair. If you would like to use a cleaning product, we suggest that you test the product on the bottom side of the seat cushion first to
                    make sure the product doesn&rsquo;t alter the material, before applying the product on the entire chair. Please note that any type of discoloration or alteration made to the chair from a cleaner will automatically void the&nbsp;warranty.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Where are the assembly instructions?</h3>
                <p>The assembly instructions are located inside the bag, on the bottom of the seat&nbsp;cushion.</p>
