            <h2>Are your stores open or&nbsp;closed?</h2>
            <p>Like you, we are following rules established by local governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Our primary focus is the health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families, as well as our customers and the communities in
                which we operate. Nearly all of our stores are reopen at this time and we encourage you to visit our <a href="/storeLocator/storeLocator.jsp">Store Locator</a> to the check hours of nearby locations and view special services that may be&nbsp;available.</p>
            <h2>What are you doing to keep your stores&nbsp;clean?</h2>

                disinfect surfaces within our stores and wearing protective face-masks. We are also limiting the amount of people admitted into the store at one time to create a safe shopping distance. In most locations, appointments are also available
                for those who prefer a private shopping experience. View our <a href="/content/comfort-is-back">Private Appointments</a> page to view availability near&nbsp;you.</p>

                process. We may also keep our distance while in your home and wear protective masks. We encourage you to do the&nbsp;same.</p>
            <p>Our white-glove delivery normally includes setup of your new furniture inside your home, an overview of your new product and removal of any packaging. We understand that you may be wary of having us in your home at present time. Therefore,
