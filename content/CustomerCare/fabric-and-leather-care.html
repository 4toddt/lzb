            <h2>Care &amp; Cleaning of Upholstery</h2>
            <p>To prevent soiling in general, frequent vacuuming or light brushing with a nonmetallic, stiff bristle
                brush to remove dust and grime is recommended. Use a professional furniture cleaning service when an
                overall soiled condition has been&nbsp;reached.</p>
            <p>To successfully clean fabric, it is important to determine the type of fabric and the recommended
                cleaning code. This information can be found on the tag attached to the&nbsp;furniture.</p>
            <h3>Code W Cleaning Instructions</h3>
            <p>Spot clean only with water-based shampoo or foam upholstery cleaner. Pretest a small, inconspicuous area
                first. Do not saturate. Clean spots or stains from the outside to the middle of the affected area to
                prevent circling. When cleaning a spill, blot immediately to remove spilled material. Pile fabrics may
                require brushing with a nonmetallic, stiff bristle brush to restore&nbsp;appearance.</p>
            <p>Do not use solvents to spot clean. Hot water extraction or steam cleaning is not recommended. Cushion
                covers should not be removed and&nbsp;laundered.</p>
            <h3>Code S Cleaning Instructions</h3>
            <p>Spot clean only with a water-free dry cleaning solvent. Pretest a small, inconspicuous area first. Do
                not saturate. Clean spots or stains from the outside to the middle of the affected area to prevent
                circling. When cleaning a spill, blot immediately to remove spilled material. Pile fabrics may require
                brushing with a nonmetallic, stiff bristle brush to restore appearance.<br />Do not use water. Cushion
                covers should not be removed and dry&nbsp;cleaned.</p>
            <h3>Code W-S Cleaning Instructions</h3>
            <h4>Water-Based Stains</h4>
            <p>Water-based stains include ketchup, mustard, wine, soft drinks and most food&nbsp;stains.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly blot the area to remove excess liquid compounds. This may be done with a paper towel or a
                    light cotton&nbsp;terrycloth.</li>
                <li>Using neutral soap and water, gently rub the soiled area from side to center to avoid a
                    halo&nbsp;effect.</li>
                <li>Rinse thoroughly with plain water to remove excess&nbsp;soap.</li>
                <li>The area may then be blotted with a clean towel, rubbing in a gentle circular motion to maintain
                    the suede surface or dried by using a hair dryer to quickly complete the drying&nbsp;process.</li>
                <li>Buff or vacuum afterwards to maintain the suede look and&nbsp;feel.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Oil-Based Stains</h4>
            <p>Oil-based stains include ink stains, cake-type shoe polish and&nbsp;cosmetics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In most cases, these stains may be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution, as with water-based
                    stains, if the area is only lightly soiled. Examples of this would be a light pen mark or light
                    shoe polish on the bottom of a&nbsp;recliner.</li>
                <li>For heavier stains, a solvent compound may be necessary. If so, any over-the-counter compound, such
                    as K2r upholstery cleaner or other nonbleaching household cleaners, may be used. Always spot clean
                    an inconspicuous area first with the cleaner to make sure the fabric will not be damaged. Always
                    follow instructions on the label of the cleaner. Lightly clean the area with neutral soap and water
                    to remove any excess&nbsp;cleaner.</li>
                <li>Dry and buff as in steps 4 and 5 for water-based&nbsp;stains.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Code X Cleaning Instructions</h3>
            <p>Do not use a foam or liquid cleaner of any type. Vacuum or brush lightly to remove&nbsp;soil.</p>
            <h2>Care &amp; Cleaning of Leather</h2>
            <h3>Leather Care Basics</h3>
            <p>Leather is a natural material which, when properly cared for, will maintain its beauty and appearance
                for many years. It is also the easiest to care for of all upholstery materials. Each leather type has
                its own care and cleaning specifications, but there are also some&nbsp;generalizations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep it clean - Dust and vacuum often, using a crevice tool in&nbsp;seams.</li>
                <li>For weekly dusting use a clean, soft lint-free cloth slightly dampened with distilled water and
                    wipe&nbsp;gently.</li>
                <li>Avoid direct exposure to sunlight. Although leather is resistant to fading, prolonged direct
                    exposure to the sun will cause any material to&nbsp;fade.</li>
                <li>Keep leather furniture at least 12" away from radiators and other heat sources. Avoiding
                    intense heat will help prevent the leather from drying and possibly&nbsp;cracking.</li>
                <li>Clean spills quickly. Just as with any upholstery, leather can become stained if spills are
                    not cleaned up immediately. If spills do occur, attend to them quickly remembering to blot, not
                    rub, the&nbsp;stain.
                    <ol>
                        <li>​Use a solution of 1/2 mild soap, such as Neutrogena or Ivory, and 1/2 distilled water on a
                            slightly dampened cloth or sponge, working up a foam to&nbsp;clean.</li>
                        <li>Avoid excessive rubbing with a cloth. Blot any remaining soap residue with a clean
                            cloth dampened only with clear distilled water. Blot until dry, repeating
                            as&nbsp;necessary.</li>
                        <li>Contact a professional leather cleaning service for more difficult&nbsp;stains.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Full Aniline Leather</h3>
            <p>Handcrafted premium leathers are treated with Aniline dye to preserve the natural, rustic beauty that
                makes each upholstered piece unique. This enhanced Crypton finish provides an invisible, protective
                shield that prolongs the life of the&nbsp;leather.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protects against harmful UV damage</li>
                <li>Repels dust, dirt and stains</li>
                <li>Replenishes natural oils</li>
                <li>Environmentally safe*</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Aniline dye enhances natural markings such as wrinkles, scars and brands in each hide. These dramatic
                color variations are hallmarks of quality and give each piece a distinctive look all
                its own. The following images show some of the types of surface variations that could
                be&nbsp;visible.</p>
