This Limited Warranty covers the following defects in material and workmanship:</p><ul><li>Any visible indentation or sag greater than one (1) inch that is not associated with an indentation or sag which results from use of an improper or unsupportive foundation.</li><li>Any physical flaw in the mattress that causes the foam material to split or crack, despite normal usage and proper handling.</li><li>Any manufacturing defect in the mattress cover such as the fabric tearing or stitching unraveling.</li></ul><p>This Limited Warranty does not cover the following:</p><ul><li>Changes to your mattress that are caused by or result from normal wear and use (please note that &ldquo;normal wear&rdquo; assumes and requires that your mattress is continuously supported by a proper foundation sufficient to support the distributed weight of your body and the mattress itself);</li><li>A normal increase in softness of the foam material;</li><li>Individual or personalized preferences relating to firmness, texture, comfort, etc.;</li><li>Mattresses sold &ldquo;as-is&rdquo;, &ldquo;preconditioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;reconditioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;used&rdquo;, &ldquo;comfort return&rdquo;, &ldquo;returned&rdquo;, &ldquo;previously owned&rdquo;, or any other similar wording indicating that the mattress is not &ldquo;new&rdquo; or of &ldquo;first quality&rdquo;, or has previously been purchased or used by another consumer;</li><li>Minor imperfections and slight cosmetic flaws;</li><li>Individual or personalized allergies and sensitivities;</li><li>Naturally-occurring cotton or foam aromas; and</li><li>Mattresses that are located outside of the United States at the time you wish to take advantage of this Limited Warranty.</li></ul><p>In addition, this Limited Warranty does not cover conditions resulting from misuse, neglect or physical abuse or damage to the mattress. Accordingly, the following circumstances, if discovered upon inspection, will void your Limited Warranty: (a) any unsanitary condition; (b) burns, cuts or tears; (c) liquid damage or stains; (d) use of the mattress on an improper bed frame; (e) physically abusing the mattress; (f) attempting to clean the mattress in an inappropriate manner; and (g) improper storage of the mattress (including storage in damp locations, areas infested with insects or rodents, or any other unprotected storage areas).</p><p>In the event of a defect, <span style="white-space:nowrap">La-Z-Boy&rsquo;s</span> sole and exclusive liability and your sole remedy under this Limited Warranty will be a replacement mattress. Should shipping costs be required to return your mattress, you will not be responsible for those costs. If you wish to replace your mattress with a more expensive mattress, you will be required to pay the difference between the original purchase price of the mattress and that of the upgraded mattress.</p><p>Replaced mattresses are subject to the same Limited Warranty as the original mattress. If you obtain a replacement mattress, the warranty term of the replacement mattress begins from the date of purchase of the original mattress. If you purchase an upgraded mattress, a new warranty term will begin upon the purchase of the upgraded mattress.</p><p>To make a claim under the <span style="white-space:nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Limited Warranty, please contact <a href="mailto:mattress@la-z-boy.com" style="white-space:nowrap">mattress@la-z-boy.com</a> or 800-375-6890. This Limited Warranty will be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan.</p><h2>Outdoor Furniture Limited Warranty</h2><p>Outdoor Furniture is manufactured by Casual Living (&ldquo;La-Z-Boy Outdoor&rdquo;), and will be free from defects in materials and workmanship (normal wear and tear, fading and stretching excepted) as provided below.</p><h3>Frame (Cast, Extruded Aluminum) &ndash; Five (5) Years</h3><p>If the furniture frame fails structurally (i.e. broken frame or welds) within five (5) years from the purchase date, we will replace in the original color and style, if available, or in a similar color and style if the original has been discontinued. Damage to frames or welds due to freeze damage and/or improper assembly are not covered.</p><h3>Frame (Steel, Wrought Iron) &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>Wrought Iron and Steel furniture is covered for one (1) year from the original purchase date against defects in manufacturing and/or workmanship. NOTE: Steel and wrought iron are not covered for rust or rust staining.</p><h3>Wicker Weave (Resin) and/or Straps &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>Straps and/or wicker weave shall be covered against separation or breaking for one (1) year from the date of purchase. Discoloration and /or fading due to exposure to elements, chemicals or harsh cleaning products are not covered.</p><h3>Powder Coat and/or Paint &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>Finishes shall be covered against blistering, cracking, or peeling for a period of one (1) year from the original date of purchase. We will replace in the original color and style, if available, or in similar color and style if the original has been discontinued. Scratches, chips, and abrasion due to normal wear and tear are not covered.</p><h3>Cushion and Pillow Construction &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>All cushions and pillows shall be covered against separation at the seams for a period of one (1) year from the original date of purchase by the initial consumer. We will repair or replace any cushion or pillow in the original color and style, if available, or in similar color and style if the original has been discontinued. Fading or discoloration is not covered.</p><h3>Solution Dyed Acrylic Fabrics &ndash; Five (5) Years</h3><p>Solution Dyed Acrylic Fabric manufacturers, like Sunbrella&reg; and Outdura&reg;, provide a five (5) year limited warranty on their fabrics. When used on our outdoor furniture, these fabrics are warranted to the original purchaser for 5 years, protecting against fabrics becoming unserviceable due to color or strength loss from normal usage and exposure conditions, including sunlight, mildew and atmospheric chemicals. This warranty covers the fabric only and is serviced by the fabric manufacturer. This warranty does not cover normal care and cleaning; damage from misuse or abuse; improper installation; or costs associated with replacement of the fabric, including labor and installation. We reserve the right to inspect the fabric submitted for claim and will supply new equivalent fabric to replace the fabric that becomes unserviceable.</p><h3>Sling Fabrics &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>All sling fabrics shall be covered against separation at the seams for a period of one (1) year from the original date of purchase. We will repair or replace any fabric in the original color and style, if available, or in similar color and style if the original has been discontinued. Fading or discoloration due to exposure to harsh chemicals is not covered.</p><h3>Wood &ndash; Three (3) Years</h3><p>If the wood fails structurally (i.e., broken frame) within three (3) years from the date of purchase, we will, at our option, replace, repair or refinish the product in the original color and style, if available, or in a similar color and style if the original has been discontinued. Wood requires user maintenance and changes in the color of wood are normal and should be expected to occur over time as the natural material ages. Therefore, fading and color changes in wood frames are not covered by this warranty. Components such as chair feet are subject to wear and tear and are not considered part of the frame.</p><h3>Alternative Stone Tops &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>Alternative Stone Tops are covered for one (1) year against defects in manufacturing and/or workmanship.</p><h3>Hardware and Components &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>If a component part (nuts, bolts, brackets, etc.) fails due to manufacturing defects within one (1) year from the date of purchase, we will replace the part.</p><h3>Umbrellas &ndash; One (1) Year</h3><p>Umbrellas are covered against failure structurally within one (1) year from the date of purchase, due to manufacturer&rsquo;s defects only. Umbrella bases are NOT covered. NOTE: Umbrellas should only be used with a table and umbrella base. Do not use in high wind or storms.</p><h3>Shipping</h3><p>If necessary, La-Z-Boy Outdoor will pay for shipping of replacement product for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase. After one (1) year, it will be the original purchaser&rsquo;s responsibility to pay for freight and any packaging costs. All orders will be assessed a handling fee and large items may require an additional handling fee.</p><h3>Exclusions</h3><p>Failure caused by unreasonable or abusive use, fire, freight damage, acts of nature (such as, but not limited to freezing or high winds), suntan oil or other chemicals (such as chlorine or exposure to salt water), normal fading, scratching or chipping of the finish, weathering or staining or discoloration of furniture, accidental damage, repair, or modifications by customer, glass breakage, burning and/or melting caused by magnified or reflected sunlight, normal wear and tear are excluded from the warranty.</p><p>Furniture used in commercial, contract or any other non-residential applications, clearance items, display models, and all other &ldquo;as is&rdquo; or outlet purchased items are not covered under this warranty. In addition, La-Z-Boy Outdoor will not be responsible for loss of use or time, inconvenience, travel, packaging, or any other consequential/incidental damages. In no event shall La-Z-Boy Outdoor&rsquo;s responsibility exceed the value of the replacement part/product. <strong>Glass breakage is not a covered item.</strong></p><h3>Care and Maintenance</h3><p>Be careful to never allow water to build up in frames as this will cause corrosion and freeze damage in cold climates. Wash all frames with a solution of mild soap and water. Rinse with clean water and dry with a soft absorbent cloth towel. Frames can be treated with a liquid wax for maximum protection against UV rays and/or salty, damp air. If your set includes cushions, slings, and/or an umbrella, they may be cleaned by hand with a solution of soap and water with a clean water rinse. Never machine wash cushions, slings or umbrella covers as this will result in shrinkage or damage. After cleaning cushions, tip on end and allow to drip dry. Never use a commercial or home dryer to tumble dry fabric goods. Do not use bleach or solvents to clean any product! This will void the warranty. <strong>NOTE: Lack of original receipt will void the warranty!</strong></p><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Read all instructions before assembly. Failure to do so may result in faulty assembly and potential injury. Assemble product on a soft, non-abrasive surface (carpet or cardboard) to avoid damaging the item. Seek assistance to assemble bulky or heavy items. After final alignment, make sure all bolts and nuts are securely tightened with screw head covers pressed in place.</p><h2>Office Furniture Limited Warranty</h2><p>Office Furniture is manufactured by True Innovations, and will be free from defects in materials and workmanship (normal wear and tear, fading and stretching excepted) for ten years from the date of purchase, except as provided below under the limited warranty.</p><p>The exceptions or exclusions to this warranty are as follows:</p><ul><li>Upholstery material and foam cushion material is warranted against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year, beginning on the date of purchase as shown on the original sales receipt.</li><li>Any warranty claim that is submitted after the limited warranty period, or without proper proof of purchase, will not include the cost of parts, labor or delivery.</li><li>This warranty shall not apply to products which have been subjected to misuse, neglect, alteration, modification or attachments either caused by the original purchaser, shipping, storage, accident, fire, flood or acts of God.</li></ul><p>In the event of a defect in material or workmanship covered by this warranty, True Innovations will repair or replace, at their discretion, without charge the warranted furniture within a reasonable amount of time.

Each party will designate one arbitrator and the two designated arbitrators will select a third arbitrator, who will serve as the chair of the arbitration panel. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on the third arbitrator, then the AAA will appoint the third arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrators will issue their decision within 120 days from the date the third arbitrator is selected by the two designated arbitrators or appointed by the AAA. The arbitrators may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all related records will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The decision and the arbitrators&rsquo; award will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. A dissenting decision will also be set forth in writing. The arbitrators&rsquo; award will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p></section></div><script>function jqIsReady(){return"undefined"!=typeof $}var rmsDealers=["02118118","02206086","02255923","20880006","20880057","23461039","23461047","28457536","47102004","47102012","47102039","48206016","50824147","50824414","50841092","50841114","50841122","50851640","50851802","50852354","50852566","50852760","50853384","50853767","50853872","50854194","50854305","50854402","50854535","50854658","50854666","50854798","50855387","50855395","50855418","50855468","50855484","50855506","50855662","50855884","50855948","50856066","50856146","50856278","50856286","50856308","50856316","50856367","50856375","50856383","50856626","50856723","50856812","50856944","50856987","50857037","50857088","50857142","50857193","50857363","50857398","50857606","50857615","50857622","50857762","50857843","50857894","50857916","50857967","50857975","50857983","50858009","50858025","50858165","50858173","50858238","50858246","50858297","50858467","50858548","50858572","50858645","50858777","50858786","50858866","50859188","50859285","50859293","50859368","50859404","50859412","50859439","50859447","50859463","50859528","50859536","50859544","50859579","50859587","50859595","50859625","50859684","50859757","50859765","50859897","50859919","50859927","50859935","50859994","50860046","50860062","50860089","50860127","50860135","50860143","50860216","50860232","50860259","50860275","50860283","50860364","50860372","50860399","50860402","50860453","50860488","50860496","50860518","50860526","50860534","50860577","50860585","50860593","50860615","50860623","50860658","50860674","50860712","50860739","50860747","50860755","50860844","50860887","50860895","50860909","50860925","50860933","50860984","50860992","50861018","50861026","50861034","50861042","50861085","50861107","50861115","50861123","50861158","50861174","50861204","50861247","50861379","50861387","50861395","50861409","50861476","50861484","50861492","50861506","50861514","50861522","50861549","50861557","50861565","50861573","50861603","50861646","50861654","50861662","50861689","50861697","50861735","50862758","50862782","50862855","50869116","50869160","50869648","50870255","50870263","50870298","50870378","50870424","50870459","50870548","50870600","50870603","50870645","50870718","50876074","50876082","50876296","50876325","50876392","50876458","85166023","85166058"];(function o(){jqIsReady()?($(document).ready(function(){$("#bcc-content input").blur(function(){""==$(this).val()?$(this).removeClass("filled"):$(this).addClass("filled")})}),$("#bcc-content form").submit(function(o){o.preventDefault();var e=$(this).find("input:invalid");return e.length?e.addClass("filled"):$.ajax({type:"POST",url:"/storeLocator/storeLocator.jsp?_DARGS=/storeLocator/storeLocator.jsp",data:{_dynSessConf:$("[name=_dynSessConf]").val()||"missing_dynSessConf",locator:$(this).find("[name=zipPostal]").val()||"missing_zipPostal",locatorSucccess:"/mobile/storeLocator/json/storeLocatorSuccess.jsp",locatorError:"/mobile/storeLocator/json/storeLocatorError.jsp",findStore:"Search","_D:locator":"","_D:locatorSucccess":"","_D:locatorError":"","_D:findStore":""},success:function(o){if("true"==o.success){var e=o.locations,t=document.createElement("div");t.id="your-locations";for(var s=0;s<e.length;s++){var r=document.createElement("DIV"),n=0<=rmsDealers.indexOf(e[s].locationId)?"(800) 375-6890":e[s].phoneNum1&&e[s].phoneNum2&&e[s].phoneNum3?"("+e[s].phoneNum1+") "+e[s].phoneNum2+"-"+e[s].phoneNum3:"";r.innerHTML="<h3>"+e[s].name+"</h3><p>"+e[s].address+"</p>"+(""!=e[s].address2?"<p>"+e[s].address2+"</p>":"")+(""!=e[s].address3?"<p>"+e[s].address3+"</p>":"")+"<p>"+e[s].city+", "+e[s].state+" "+e[s].zip+"</p>"+(""!=n?'<a href="tel:'+n+'">'+n+"</a>":""),t.appendChild(r)}nonVideoModal("<h2>Locations that match your search</h2>"+t.outerHTML),$("#npc-modal-content").click(function(o){o.stopPropagation()})}else alert("No Stores Found.
