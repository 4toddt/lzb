    <h2>MATTRESS LIMITED WARRANTY</h2>
    <p><span style="white-space: nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> warrants your mattress for a period of ten (10) years from the date of purchase. This Limited Warranty covers the following defects in material and workmanship:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any visible indentation or sag greater than one (1) inch that is not associated with an indentation or sag which results from use of an improper or unsupportive foundation.</li>
        <li>Any physical flaw in the mattress that causes the foam material to split or crack, despite normal usage and proper handling.</li>
        <li>Any manufacturing defect in the mattress cover such as the fabric tearing or stitching unraveling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This Limited Warranty does not cover the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Changes to your mattress that are caused by or result from normal wear and use (please note that &ldquo;normal wear&rdquo; assumes and requires that your mattress is continuously supported by a proper foundation sufficient to support the distributed
            weight of your body and the mattress itself);</li>
        <li>A normal increase in softness of the foam material;</li>
        <li>Individual or personalized preferences relating to firmness, texture, comfort, etc.;</li>
        <li>Mattresses sold &ldquo;as-is&rdquo;, &ldquo;preconditioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;reconditioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;used&rdquo;, &ldquo;comfort return&rdquo;, &ldquo;returned&rdquo;, &ldquo;previously owned&rdquo;, or any other similar wording indicating that
            the mattress is not &ldquo;new&rdquo; or of &ldquo;first quality&rdquo;, or has previously been purchased or used by another consumer;</li>
        <li>Minor imperfections and slight cosmetic flaws;</li>
        <li>Individual or personalized allergies and sensitivities;</li>
        <li>Naturally-occurring cotton or foam aromas; and</li>
        <li>Mattresses that are located outside of the United States at the time you wish to take advantage of this Limited Warranty.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, this Limited Warranty does not cover conditions resulting from misuse, neglect or physical abuse or damage to the mattress. Accordingly, the following circumstances, if discovered upon inspection, will void your Limited Warranty: (a)
        any unsanitary condition; (b) burns, cuts or tears; (c) liquid damage or stains; (d) use of the mattress on an improper bed frame; (e) physically abusing the mattress; (f) attempting to clean the mattress in an inappropriate manner; and (g) improper
        storage of the mattress (including storage in damp locations, areas infested with insects or rodents, or any other unprotected storage areas).</p>
    <p>In the event of a defect, <span style="white-space: nowrap">La-Z-Boy&rsquo;s</span> sole and exclusive liability and your sole remedy under this Limited Warranty will be a replacement mattress. Should shipping costs be required to return your mattress,
        you will not be responsible for those costs. If you wish to replace your mattress with a more expensive mattress, you will be required to pay the difference between the original purchase price of the mattress and that of the upgraded mattress.</p>
    <p>Replaced mattresses are subject to the same Limited Warranty as the original mattress. If you obtain a replacement mattress, the warranty term of the replacement mattress begins from the date of purchase of the original mattress. If you purchase an
        upgraded mattress, a new warranty term will begin upon the purchase of the upgraded mattress.</p>
    <p>To make a claim under the <span style="white-space: nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> Limited Warranty, please contact <a href="mailto:mattress@la-z-boy.com" style="white-space: nowrap">mattress@la-z-boy.com</a> or 800-375-6890.</p>
