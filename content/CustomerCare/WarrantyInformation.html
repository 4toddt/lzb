    <h3>Returns and Exchanges.</h3>
    <p>We will allow you to return your mattress at any time during your 100-day trial period. If your mattress was never removed from its box, you'll print a prepaid shipping label and drop the box off at UPS. For mattresses that are fully expanded and
        out of the box, please contact us at +1 800-375-6890 to initiate your return. We'll work with you to arrange a pickup through a local charity or recycling partner and refund you in full. Your original form of payment will be refunded within two
        weeks. Your 100-day trial begins when your mattress is delivered.</p>
    <h3>Limited Warranty</h3>
    <p>La-Z-Boy warrants your mattress for a period of ten (10) years from the date of purchase. This Limited Warranty covers the following defects in material and workmanship:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any visible indentation or sag greater than one (1) inch that is not associated with an indentation or sag which results from use of an improper or unsupportive foundation.</li>
        <li>Any physical flaw in the mattress that causes the foam material to split or crack, despite normal usage and proper handling.</li>
        <li>Any manufacturing defect in the mattress cover such as the fabric tearing or stitching unraveling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Limited Warranty does not cover the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Changes to your mattress that are caused by or result from normal wear and use (please note that &ldquo;normal wear&rdquo; assumes and requires that your mattress is continuously supported by a proper foundation sufficient to support the distributed
            weight of your body and the mattress itself);</li>
        <li>A normal increase in softness of the foam material;</li>
        <li>Individual or personalized preferences relating to firmness, texture, comfort, etc.;</li>
        <li>[Mattresses sold &ldquo;as-is&rdquo;, &ldquo;preconditioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;reconditioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;used&rdquo;, &ldquo;comfort return&rdquo;, &ldquo;returned&rdquo;, &ldquo;previously owned&rdquo;, or any other similar wording indicating
            that the mattress is not &ldquo;new&rdquo; or of &ldquo;first quality&rdquo;, or has previously been purchased or used by another consumer;]</li>
        <li>Minor imperfections and slight cosmetic flaws;</li>
        <li>Individual or personalized allergies and sensitivities;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>In addition, this Limited Warranty does not cover conditions resulting from misuse, neglect or physical abuse or damage to the mattress. Accordingly, the following circumstances, if discovered upon inspection, will void your Limited Warranty: (a)
        any unsanitary condition; (b) burns, cuts or tears; (c) liquid damage or stains; (d) use of the mattress on an improper bed frame; (e) physically abusing the mattress; (f) attempting to clean the mattress in an inappropriate manner; and (g) improper
        storage of the mattress (including storage in damp locations, areas infested with insects or rodents, or any other unprotected storage areas).</p>
    <p>In the event of a defect, La-Z-Boy&rsquo;s sole and exclusive liability and your sole remedy under this Limited Warranty will be a replacement mattress. Should shipping costs be required to return your mattress, you will [not] be responsible for those
        costs. If you wish to replace your mattress with a more expensive mattress, you will be required to pay the difference between the original purchase price of the mattress and that of the upgraded mattress.</p>
    <p>Replaced mattresses are subject to the same Limited Warranty as the original mattress. If you obtain a replacement mattress, the warranty term of the replacement mattress begins from the date of purchase of the original mattress. If you purchase an
        upgraded mattress, a new warranty term will begin upon the purchase of the upgraded mattress.To make a claim under the La-Z-Boy Limited Warranty, please contact us at +1 800-375-6890.</p>

    <h3>Arbitration</h3>
    <p>In the event a dispute arises between you and La-Z-Boy arising out of this Limited Warranty, such dispute will be determined and settled by binding arbitration between the parties, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
        Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). More information about the AAA is located at <a href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, or you can call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>
    <p>You must seek arbitration for disputes arising out of this Limited Warranty prior to exercising any rights or seeking any remedies created by the Title I of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act. If you choose to pursue any rights and remedies that are not
        created by Title I of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, then arbitration is not required.</p>
    <p>Arbitration will take place in Monroe, Michigan.</p>
    <p>The arbitration will not be combined with any other proceeding or arbitration against one of the parties. Each party will designate one arbitrator and the two designated arbitrators will select a third arbitrator, who will serve as the chair of the
        arbitration panel. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on the third arbitrator, then the AAA will appoint the third arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrators will issue their decision within 120 days from the date the third
        arbitrator is selected by the two designated arbitrators or appointed by the AAA. The arbitrators may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential
        and all related records will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The decision and the arbitrators&rsquo; award will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons
        for the disposition of any claim. A dissenting decision will also be set forth in writing. The arbitrators&rsquo; award will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
