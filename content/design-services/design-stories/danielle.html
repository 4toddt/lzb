                    <h2>The opportunity</h2>
                    <p>The family wanted their crowded family room to feel more open, but also needed additional seating. After years of traveling they had many beautiful items they wanted incorporated into the design, including a collection of oriental
                        pieces, which really inspired the look.</p>
                    <div class="image"><img src="/Images/design-services/design-stories/danielle/room01.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <h2>The experience</h2>
                    <p>The client was very pleased with our input and ideas and were excited that we were able to accommodate all of their functional needs into the design. We were able to solve every problem they had!</p>

                    <h2>The result</h2>
                    <p>The client loved how the room felt larger and more open, even after adding more seats! They also loved the quality and comfort of their new furniture. My goal is to make things easy for my clients, and they appreciated not having to
                        stress or worry about the process.</p>
