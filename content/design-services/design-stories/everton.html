                    <h2>The opportunity</h2>
                    <p>I have worked with this family before. Since they had a great experience they came back to update their living room. They were tired of the design and wanted something different and fresh, but with two children, still needed it to
                        be functional and <span class="no-wrap">family-friendly.</span></p>

                    <h2>The experience</h2>
                    <p>My client was open to all of my suggestions. I helped them choose everything from paint colors to window treatments, and even advised on a new fireplace design. The original fireplace was red&nbsp;brick.</p>

                    <h2>The result</h2>
                    <p>They couldn’t believe it was the same room! It looked just like they envisioned and they couldn’t believe that all the beautiful pieces were theirs to keep! The family couldn’t wait to show off their new room. They also recommended
                        our service to neighbors and&nbsp;family.</p>
