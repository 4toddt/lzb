                    <p class="heading">How do you determine the right style for your customers?</p>
                    <p>I spend a good amount of time with each client just chatting about what they are dreaming about for their home. Style is so personal and individual and specific to each client. It goes beyond what something simply looks like. It’s
                        really a way you live, and what you want your home to reflect.</p>

                    <p class="heading">Where do find your inspiration?</p>
                    <p>My inspiration comes from the people that I work with. I am inspired by their goals and vision, and what they want their home to be. When I get stuck, I use sites like Houzz and Instagram to move me outside of my box.</p>
                    <p class="heading">What aspect of your job brings you the greatest joy?</p>
                    <p>I love being a part of improving the lives of the people I work with. Home is the place where memories are made, experiences are had and relationships are built. It is a privilege to be a part of that impact.</p>

                                    rooms as they would look with the items we were going to purchase. They spent so much time with us and made sure we were happy with the items we purchased. They were not only good at their jobs, they are great people.</p>

                                <p>Kelly and Sonja did an amazing job helping me bring my vision to life! They keyed in on my style and very quickly, showed me great pieces that I might not have considered, and helped bring depth to the design. They even
                                    took into account the adjoining rooms so everything works well together. I especially appreciated being able to see what the room will look like from each entry point and that they are able to incorporate some of my
                                    favorite existing pieces. it’s going to look fantastic and leave no doubt that it’s MY home.</p>
