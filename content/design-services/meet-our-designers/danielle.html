                    <p>Come into the store armed with as much information as possible! Bring floor and wall colors, dimensions and lots of pictures. The more information that you have to share, the easier it is to guide you in the right direction. Plus,
                        be open to stepping outside of your comfort zone! You don’t have to get too wild but if you’re already making changes, push yourself just a bit. You’ll probably end up loving it!</p>

                    <p>My favorite part is seeing my client’s vision come to life. I could design their room in an infinite number of ways, but only one will be perfect for them. To help determine their style, I use a combination of the frames and fabrics
                        that they select as well as what I see in their home. There is a common thread that weaves its way through every single item they gravitate toward. It’s my job to pick up on the commonalities.</p>
                    <p class="heading">What is your favorite way to spend your Saturday?</p>
                    <p>I try to spend as much time with my family as possible during my days off and am usually testing out some new recipe for us to try. I also have an obsession with real-life crime shows, so you’re likely to find them on my television
                        when I find a free moment!</p>
