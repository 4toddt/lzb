                    <p class="heading">What is a common concern you get from customers regarding the design&nbsp;process?</p>
                    <p>Some clients fear their style will be compromised by the designer’s own personal taste. I let clients know that I am there to help bring their vision to life. Part of that process may include additional aspects the client may not have
                        thought about, but these are only suggestions. Ultimately, it’s the client's choice what they want to&nbsp;incorporate.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="heading">How do you determine the right style for your&nbsp;customers?</p>
                    <p>I am always listening and observing. You can learn so much about an individual and their lifestyle just by taking a step back and engaging in open-ended questions. Paying attention to the subtle details, you can gain a lot more information
                        than they may be able to&nbsp;articulate.</p>
                    <p class="heading">Where do you go to find&nbsp;inspiration?</p>
                    <p>Inspiration lies everywhere. Nature, art, human emotion; with a bit of imagination and an open mind, inspiration will come in many forms. Sometimes it can strike at two o’clock in the&nbsp;morning!</p>
