                    <p class="heading">What’s your #1 design tip?</p>
                    <p>The design tip I cannot stress enough is that when combining patterns to make sure that you keep in mind to have different scales of fabrics. I have a lot of clients that like all different kinds of patterns but want to make sure they
                        can combine them. I tell them they can as long as they vary in scale. You can have a large pattern on a chair but then a smaller pattern on a rug and vice-versa; as long as you don’t have multiple patterns that hold the same weight
                        in scale.</p>

                    <p>My favorite part is making their house into a home. I love helping them bring their wants and needs to life. I also love seeing their reactions when I can make their dreams come true.</p>
                    <p class="heading">Where do you find your inspiration?</p>
                    <p>I find my inspiration from what is around me. I can find it from a piece of art or nature and even fashion. I find inspiration from all over. The world is all color and design so it is really easy to find my inspiration anywhere.</p>
