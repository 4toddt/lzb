<p style="text-align:center">Social Compliance - Including Disclosures Under the<br /><u>California Transparency in
        Supply Chains Act of 2010 – SB 657</u></p>
<p>La-Z-Boy Incorporated has adopted a human and labor rights policy that applies to our operations and our suppliers.
    We respect and promote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO)
    conventions that establish international human and labor rights. La-Z-Boy Incorporated strives to provide our
    employees with a fair, safe, and non-discriminatory work environment. We seek to apply both the letter and spirit
    of all applicable national, state and local laws and to promote continuous improvement in our operations. We hold
    our business partners, suppliers, contractors, and vendors to these same standards and actively seek partners who
    share our&nbsp;beliefs.</p>
<p>Our manufacturing subsidiary has implemented the following efforts:</p>
<p><u>Risk-based Supplier Assessments</u> – We have internally reviewed our supplier base and will assess future
    potential suppliers to determine the level of risk associated with each supplier in regards to slavery and human
    trafficking. We have not utilized a third party in performing this&nbsp;review.</p>
<p><u>Direct Supplier Certifications</u> – We have communicated directly with each of our suppliers whose materials are
    incorporated into our product, requiring them to certify that they comply with the laws regarding slavery and human
    trafficking of the country or countries in which they do&nbsp;business.</p>
<p><u>Supply Chain Employees and Management Training</u> – We train employees responsible for supply chain management
    on how to identify and respond to supply chain issues such as slavery and human trafficking. We require all
    employees and suppliers to comply with our Human and Labor Rights&nbsp;Policy.</p>
<p><u>Accountability Standards and Procedures</u> – Our Human and Labor Rights Policy provides accountability standards
    for employees or suppliers that do not meet company standards concerning slavery and human trafficking. We
    communicate to suppliers our slavery and human trafficking policy and supplier workplace standard through our
    social compliance supplier manual. We seek relationships with suppliers that are committed to manufacturing
    products under fair and safe working conditions and sound environmental practices. If we determine that a supplier
    does not comply with this policy, we will work with the supplier to develop and implement an appropriate corrective
    action plan, or may depending on the circumstances, end our relationship with the&nbsp;supplier.</p>
<p><u>Supplier Audits</u> – Our personnel currently complete announced quality and social compliance supplier audits at
    overseas operations, which include a review of working conditions to ensure suppliers comply with company standards
    on slavery and human trafficking. Our social compliance manager, sourcing managers or other employees conduct site
    visits to supplier manufacturing facilities prior to beginning a relationship with a supplier. We do not utilize
    independent or unannounced&nbsp;audits.</p>
