    Use of Your Information
</h2>
<p>
    Authorized <span style="white-space: nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> employees internally use information collected on our Web site for four main purposes. First, we collect information to figure out how to improve our site by seeing which areas&rsquo; features
    and products are most popular. Second, we collect information to administer our business, provide superior service, and communicate information about our products and services that we believe to be of interest to you. Third, we collect information
    in order to personalize the site for our customers. For example, in the future, we may recommend products or features you may like based on what you have liked in the past. Last, we collect information to enable customers to participate in sweepstakes,
    contests and other activities on our Web site. If we collect any such information, we will only collect enough information to enable you to participate in the activity and no more. If we want to collect information for other purposes, we will inform
    you when we collect the information. Occasionally,
    <span style="white-space: nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> may also share non-personal, summary information regarding our customers with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose the aggregate number of registered users of our Web site). However,
    <span style="white-space: nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span> does not share any personal information about any particular customer with unrelated third parties. (We may do so in the unlikely event that we believe that disclosure of such information is reasonably
    necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (iii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety
    of <span style="white-space: nowrap">La-Z-Boy</span>, its users or the public). If you do not want to receive e-mail from us and currently do, please reply to an e-mail that we have sent to you and insert &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; in the subject line,
    or click the &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; link at the bottom of any of our emails.
