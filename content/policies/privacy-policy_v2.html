        <li>Social media information you provide to us, as detailed in the next section.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sharing Data</h3>
    <p>We only share data in two circumstances.</p>
    <p>First, we share data in order to provide you with a service you have asked for or to obtain a service we have a legitimate interest in receiving. Examples include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sharing your address and contact information with a delivery company providing last-mile delivery services for your furniture order.</li>
        <li>Sharing your address, contact information, and product details with a third-party furniture repair company in order to make a repair that you have requested.</li>
        <li>Contracting a professional mailing company to mail advertisements on our behalf.</li>
        <li>Using a cloud service provider as a host for one of our databases.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Second, we may contribute Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as name, address, email, phone number, as well as, transactional history, keyed to device-identifying information such as IP and Media Access Control addresses, to a data-sharing co-op with a number of retailers with similar customer profiles across a number of industries,
        including high-end apparel, electronics, home improvement, etc. This co-op allows us and the other anonymous retailers to identify new prospective customers and
        market to them accordingly. To have your data excluded from our participation in the co-op, please consult the &ldquo;Your Rights Over Your Data&rdquo; section below.</p>
    <h3>Access to Your Social Media Information</h3>
    <p>You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties through social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings
        on that site. Typically, we will have access to posts you have made that mention us by name as well as anything you have shared from our website with others using the sharing interface provided, as well as the people you have shared it with. By
        authorizing <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> to have access to this information, you agree that <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>

        and practices, we can reveal the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We conceptualize our information security program and objectives using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and other well-established, business cybersecurity standards.</li>
        <li>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption while your information is in transit.</li>
        <li>We contract with <a href="https://www.authorize.net/">authorize.net</a> for payment processing and do not retain or store your credit card or other payment details ourselves. Instead, we store a token that points to a record within their system,

    </ol>

    <h2>Rights Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>California law requires certain businesses to disclose information regarding the rights of California residents pursuant to the CCPA.</p>
    <p>A California resident may request that <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> share the following information:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The categories of personal information <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> has collected about you in the preceding 12 months;</li>
        <li>The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;</li>
        <li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information;</li>
        <li>The categories of third parties with which <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> shares personal information;</li>
        <li>The categories of personal information about you that <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> sold to third parties in the preceding 12 months and the categories of third parties to which the personal information was sold;</li>
        <li>The categories of personal information about you that <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> disclosed for a business purpose, as defined in the CCPA, in the preceding 12 months and the categories of third parties to which the personal information
            was disclosed;</li>
        <li>The specific pieces of personal information <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> has collected about you.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A California resident may request the disclosure of the information listed above by calling 800-375-6890, or submitting a request at <a href="https://www.la-z-boy.com/content/CustomerCare/dsr?setviewtype=full">https://www.la-z-boy.com/content/CustomerCare/dsr</a>.
        Such a request may be referred to as a right to know request. Pursuant to California law, <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> will verify the California resident&rsquo;s identity before complying with any such request.</p>
    <p>A California resident has the right to request that <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> delete any personal information about the California resident that it has collected about the California resident, and that <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span>        direct any service provider to delete the California resident&rsquo;s personal information from its records. Such a request may be referred to as a request to delete. However, pursuant to the CCPA, your information may not be deleted under certain
        circumstances, including where maintenance of your personal information is necessary: to complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance
        with federal law, provide a good or service that you requested or that is reasonably anticipated within the context of your ongoing business relationship with <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span>, or otherwise perform a contract between
        <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> and you; to detect security incidents, protect against or prosecute fraudulent or illegal activity; to enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship
        with <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span>; to comply with a legal obligation; or to otherwise use your information internally in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.</p>
    <p>For more information about these and other situations in which we may not delete your information, please see California Civil Code Section 1798.105(d). A California resident may request the deletion of information collected about the California resident
        by calling 800-375-6890, or submitting a request at <a href="https://www.la-z-boy.com/content/CustomerCare/dsr?setviewtype=full">https://www.la-z-boy.com/content/CustomerCare/dsr</a>. Before deleting your personal information, <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span>        will verify your identity.</p>
    <p>A California resident may use an authorized agent to submit a right to know request or a request to delete. To use an authorized agent, the California resident must provide <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> with written authorization. In addition,
        the California resident may be required to verify their own identity with <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span>. <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by
        the California resident to act on their behalf. Such requirements, however, will not apply where a California resident has provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code section 4000 to 4465.</p>
    <p>A California resident has the right, at any time, to direct <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> not to sell their personal information. This right may be referred to as the right to opt-out. You may opt out of the sale of your personal information by submitting a &ldquo;Stop of Sale&rdquo; request at <a href="https://www.la-z-boy.com/content/CustomerCare/dsr?setviewtype=full">https://www.la-z-boy.com/content/CustomerCare/dsr</a>. If <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> has a good faith, reasonable, and documented belief that a request opt-out is fraudulent,
        it may deny the request. A California resident may use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out on the California resident&rsquo;s behalf. The California resident must provide the authorized agent with written authorization do so.
        <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the California resident to act on the California resident&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
    <p>In addition, <span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> does not and will not sell the personal information of a California resident it has actual knowledge is under the age of 16 without affirmative authorization (known as &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo;).</p>
    <p><span class="no-wrap">La-Z-Boy</span> will not discriminate against a California resident because the California resident exercised any of their rights under the CCPA, including, but not limited to, by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Denying goods or services to the California resident;</li>
        <li>Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;</li>
        <li>Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the California resident;</li>
