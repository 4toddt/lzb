    </div>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>We demonstrate responsible environmental management by complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and obligations in addition to working to reduce the environmental burden of waste generation and emissions to the air, water and
            land. We strive to ensure that any waste generated is properly disposed of in a safe and responsible manner and we also seek out opportunities for recycling, pollution prevention and efficient use of natural resources, including energy. We
            utilize our EFEC initiatives to develop and implement a rigorous reuse and recycling&nbsp;program.

    <h2>Electronic waste</h2>
    <p>We strive to comply with all local, state, federal and international rules and regulations related to electronic waste through appropriate recycling and disposal of these&nbsp;materials.</p>
    <h2>Emissions and&nbsp;spills</h2>
    <p>Our manufacturing operations obtain the appropriate air emission permits for the regulated activities at their site, including implementation of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Wood Manufacturing Operations at the
        appropriate locations. Many of the materials we utilize do not have volatile organic emissions or are extremely low such as water-based adhesives and TSCA Title VI / California Air Resource Board composite-wood formaldehyde air emissions compliant
        materials. In addition, we have not had any major on-site spills during Fiscal&nbsp;2020.
    </p>
    <h2>Hazardous and non-hazardous&nbsp;waste</h2>
    <p>We are focused on reducing waste, increasing recycling and energy efficiency, and consuming fewer resources. Implementing the EFEC environmental management system has aided us to complete many initiatives to reduce, reuse and recycle our waste materials.
        In fact, eight of our facilities are zero waste to the&nbsp;landfill.</p>
    <p>We recycle, reutilize or reuse most of the business waste, production waste, chemical waste and packaging waste at our <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Branded Manufacturing operations (including our Cut and Sew Center in Mexico),
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Casegoods U.S. operations, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Distribution Centers, and our World Headquarters (“utility monitored operations”). We strive to ensure that any waste
        generated is properly disposed of in a safe and environmentally sound manner in accordance with our environmental policy. We are evaluating methods to increase our recycling efforts for our other business&nbsp;units.</p>
    <p>The amount of waste and recycled material generated as a result of our waste and recycling monitored operations for Fiscal 2019* is as&nbsp;follows:</p>

    <p>We are evaluating methods to increase our corporate data management systems for hazardous and non-hazardous waste for our other business unit operations but believe they are significantly less than those provided&nbsp;above.</p>
    <p>We have reduced the amount of waste disposed by our LZB Branded Manufacturing operations compared with 2007 usage as&nbsp;follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We reuse, recycle, or reutilize 97% of our LZB Branded Manufacturing&nbsp;waste</li>
        <li>Eliminated 12 million pounds of landfill waste compared to&nbsp;2007</li>
        <li>Reduced waste going to the landfill per equivalent unit of furniture to 0.66 pounds per equivalent furniture unit in Fiscal 2019 from 6.9 pounds per equivalent unit in&nbsp;2007</li>
        <li>Eight of our facilities are zero waste to the&nbsp;landfill</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>VOC Emissions</h2>
    <p>In order to better provide information related to wood supply chain management, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is committed to creating a program which includes working with our engineered wood suppliers to gain information related
        to third-party forest management. We will also be requesting data from our domestic hardwood suppliers to show their forestry best practices and responsible sourcing methods. Additionally, we will evaluate our imported wood sourcing to ensure
        ethical practices, including the requirements of the Lacey Act and other sustainable&nbsp;initiatives.</p>
    <h2>Packaging material</h2>
    <p>We either reuse or recycle as much packaging material as possible from our manufacturing locations, distribution warehouses or when furniture is delivered to our customers. Plastic, cardboard, metal and many other items are all recycled within our
        manufacturing facilities. The distribution centers have a packaging return program with our manufacturing facilities for many items (including card board boxes and plastic bags furniture is transported in). We recycle the packaging materials at
        the RDCs that are not reused (including densifiers to recycle Styrofoam). Packaging associated with the furniture that our distribution centers deliver is removed prior to delivery (either reused or recycled) and re-usable furniture blankets are
        used to deliver&nbsp;furniture.</p>
    <h2>Conservation and resource management</h2>
    <p>We have greatly reduced our use of landfills or other off-site disposal means, and eight of our facilities are zero waste to landfill. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we continue to improve the efficiency of our operations,
        increase our use of recycled materials, and control raw material&nbsp;waste.</p>
    <p>Corporate-owned <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture <span class="registered">Galleries</span> stores are reducing their carbon footprint by decreasing energy use and utilizing greener construction materials, eco-friendly light
        bulbs, paint and&nbsp;flooring.</p>

    <p>We continue to seek and embrace additional sustainable initiatives and best practices, including opportunities to incorporate renewable energy sources. Our Severn, Maryland store now relies on a rooftop solar energy system for 70% of its energy&nbsp;needs.
