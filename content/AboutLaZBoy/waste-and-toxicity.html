            <h2>Electronic waste</h2>
            <p>We strive to comply with all local, state, federal and international rules and regulations related to electronic waste through appropriate recycling and disposal of these&nbsp;materials.</p>
            <h2>Emissions and&nbsp;spills</h2>
            <p>Our manufacturing operations obtain the appropriate air emission permits for the regulated activities at their site, including implementation of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Wood Manufacturing Operations
                at the appropriate locations. Many of the materials we utilize do not have volatile organic emissions or are extremely low such as water-based adhesives and TSCA Title VI / California Air Resource Board composite-wood formaldehyde air
                emissions compliant materials. In addition, we have not had any major on-site spills during Fiscal&nbsp;2019.</p>
            <h2>Hazardous and non-hazardous&nbsp;waste</h2>
            <p>We are focused on reducing waste, increasing recycling and energy efficiency, and consuming fewer resources. Implementing the EFEC environmental management system has aided us to complete many initiatives to reduce, reuse and recycle our waste
                materials. In fact, nine of our facilities are zero waste to the&nbsp;landfill.</p>
            <p>We recycle, reutilize or reuse most of the business waste, production waste, chemical waste and packaging waste at our <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Branded Manufacturing operations (including our Cut and Sew Center
                in Mexico), <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Casegoods U.S. operations, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Distribution Centers, and our World Headquarters (“utility monitored operations”). We strive to
                ensure that any waste generated is properly disposed of in a safe and environmentally sound manner in accordance with our environmental policy. We are evaluating methods to increase our recycling efforts for our other business&nbsp;units.</p>
            <p>The amount of waste and recycled material generated as a result of our waste and recycling monitored operations for Fiscal 2018 is as&nbsp;follows:</p>

            <p>We are evaluating methods to increase our corporate data management systems for hazardous and non-hazardous waste for our other business unit operations but believe they are significantly less than those provided&nbsp;above.</p>
            <p>We have reduced the amount of waste disposed by our LZB Branded Manufacturing operations compared with 2007 usage as&nbsp;follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We reuse, recycle, or reutilize 97% of our LZB Branded Manufacturing&nbsp;waste</li>
                <li>Eliminated 12 million pounds of landfill waste compared to&nbsp;2007</li>
                <li>Reduced waste going to the landfill per equivalent unit of furniture to 0.66 pounds per equivalent furniture unit in Fiscal 2019 from 6.9 pounds per equivalent unit in&nbsp;2007</li>
                <li>Nine of our facilities are zero waste to the&nbsp;landfill</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Packaging material</h2>
            <p>We either reuse or recycle as much packaging material as possible from our manufacturing locations, distribution warehouses or when furniture is delivered to our customers. Plastic, cardboard, metal and many other items are all recycled within
                our manufacturing facilities. The distribution centers have a packaging return program with our manufacturing facilities for many items (including card board boxes and plastic bags furniture is transported in). We recycle the packaging
                materials at the RDCs that are not reused (including densifiers to recycle Styrofoam). Packaging associated with the furniture that our distribution centers deliver is removed prior to delivery (either reused or recycled) and re-usable
                furniture blankets are used to deliver&nbsp;furniture.</p>
            <h2>Conservation and resource management</h2>
            <p>We have greatly reduced our use of landfills or other off-site disposal means, and nine of our facilities are zero waste to landfill. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we continue to improve the efficiency of our operations,
                increase our use of recycled materials, and control raw material&nbsp;waste.</p>
            <p>Corporate-owned <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture Galleries&reg; stores are reducing their carbon footprint by decreasing energy use and utilizing greener construction materials, eco-friendly light bulbs, paint and&nbsp;flooring.</p>
