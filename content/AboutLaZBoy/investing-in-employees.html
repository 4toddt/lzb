        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>The mission of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is to build an environment of everyday leadership by continually investing in employee growth and development. We accomplish this goal through core leadership training programs
            focused on feedback and coaching, as well as targeted development for high-potential employees and individuals in key roles. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> also honors employee accomplishments through our Bravo recognition
            platform where managers and peers can send personal messages and rewards for a job well&nbsp;done.

        <h2>Employee engagement</h2>
        <p><span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> conducted an enterprise-wide employee engagement survey in March of 2019, with a greater than 85% response rate. The survey measured both employee engagement and employee enablement.
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> scored at or above the relevant benchmarks in both categories. Key strengths include that our people are committed to the company&rsquo;s strategy, that we have a strong performance culture
            where employees understand what is expected of them, and that <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> expects high levels of performance. Our commitment to quality also is evident in the survey&rsquo;s results with respect to providing
            high-quality customer experiences and our employees&rsquo; commitment to delivering high-quality work. As an opportunity, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is actively working to improve its approach to decision making by
            delegating authority and empowering our employees to develop solutions to business challenges. The company plans to conduct follow-up surveys every two to three years.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating a diverse &amp; inclusive culture</h2>
        <p>We believe in creating a workplace that reflects the world in which we live. To support this, we launched a Diversity and Inclusion Council at our corporate headquarters, which will be extended throughout the organization. Our Diversity and Inclusion
            Council helps our employees find common ground and use their collective voices to make a difference at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>. It enables a structure to: provide advocacy and support for diverse employees; encourage
            talent acquisition to deliver diverse candidate slates; partner with community organizations that serve diverse populations; and develop learning opportunities for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>&nbsp;employees.</p>

        <h2>Employee safety & well-being</h2>
        <p>At <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>, the safety and wellness of our employees is paramount to our culture. Through training, education and an extensive awareness program, we empower employees and leaders to help ensure everyone
            stays safe on the job. As of the end of Fiscal 2020, two of our manufacturing locations have celebrated furniture industry leading milestones without a lost-time incident. Our Dayton, TN facility achieved 18,808,706 hours, and our Neosho,
            MO plant achieved 11,501,803 hours without a lost-time incident. Both records eclipse the prior American Home Furnishings Association record of 6.5 million hours set in 2006 and they are both continuing to extend as of the end of Fiscal&nbsp;2020.</p>
        <p>Since Fiscal 2012, on an enterprise-wide basis, we have reduced our OSHA Recordable Injury Rate by over 70% and are among the best in the&nbsp;industry.</p>
        <p>The company&rsquo;s 2019 employee engagement survey indicated that our employees believe our commitment to safety is one of our clear strengths and a hallmark of our environment and&nbsp;culture.</p>

    <h2>Supplier relations</h2>
    <p>A close, collaborative relationship with suppliers allows us to provide maximum value to our customers through competitive prices, high quality and world-class service. These relationships are reinforced at our annual <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>        Supplier Summit, where we recognize our best performing suppliers, share business updates, and roll-out new programs. We also discuss the importance of environmental initiatives, working with suppliers to integrate sound and sustainable business
        practices that have an impact in their local communities as well as globally. We believe that creating an atmosphere where employees and suppliers work well together is key to everyone&rsquo;s&nbsp;success.
