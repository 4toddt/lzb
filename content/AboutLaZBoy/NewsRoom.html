                        <p>&ldquo;When developing Duo, our goal was to bring the great look of a stationary sofa together with the comfort of a motion piece,&rdquo; said Gregg Schweir, vice president of research and development for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>.
                            &ldquo;Today, most reclining furniture has a distinct look, and we rose above that stereotype by creating a beautiful reclining sofa that was not limited by styling options.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p><span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is excited to introduce iClean&trade;, its new and innovative stain-repelling fabric. iClean&trade; is a high-performance fabric that incorporates safe, sophisticated chemistry
                            to protect and surround each fiber, repelling spills before they turn into stains. Everyday spills are now protected with iClean&trade;, including coffee, wine, salsa, dirt, chocolate and more.</p>
                        <p>So how does it work? iClean&trade; fabrics are completely immersed in a stain resistant solution assuring every single fiber has been treated. This process leaves a concentrated barrier of protection while still keeping the touch
                            soft and luxurious.</p>

                        <p>La-Z-Boy is pleased to announce today that it has been awarded LEED&reg; Silver Certification for its new World Headquarters. The LEED rating system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), is the foremost program

                        <p>The 200,000-square-foot World Headquarters was completed in March 2015 in partnership with design/build contractor Rudolph/Libbe Inc. of the Rudolph Libbe Group. The building &ndash; which was built to the latest energy-efficient
                            standards &ndash; features a three-story, glassed-in lobby with an oak savannah view and natural lighting. The building occupies about 40 acres of a total 120; the remaining 80 acres, which include an endangered oak savanna
                            ecosystem, have been left untouched as a nature preserve.</p>

                        <p class="date">September 8, 2015</p>
                        <p><span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is celebrating mothers across the U.S. and Canada today by recognizing the ups &ndash; and downs &ndash; that go along with getting their children back-to-school. By creating a
                            community of parents who can share their stories of the chaos, they can #TakeComfort in knowing they are not alone. Many moms spend countless hours getting ready for the big day, from purchasing school supplies to new clothes,
                            and yet despite all their efforts and meticulous preparation, the inevitable happens and the day doesn&rsquo;t go according to plan. Someone sleeps past the alarm, orange juice spills on that new shirt …it&rsquo;s a total #MomFail.</p>
                        <p>The bright side of any #MomFail is the enduring sense of camaraderie among parents &ndash; and every mom who has been there, done that. Not to mention all of the funny stories that get shared with friends and family, and passed
                            down through the ages.</p>
