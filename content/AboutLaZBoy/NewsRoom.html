                <h1>La-Z-Boy Signs Long-term Renewable Energy Deal</h1>
                <p class="date">April 21, 2021</p>
                <p>La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in residential furniture, has finalized a 10-year resource-backed virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA), extending through the end of 2030, with AEP Energy Partners, a competitive energy
                    subsidiary of American Electric Power (Nasdaq: AEP). The agreement signifies a meaningful initiative as La-Z-Boy expands its environmental programs in its quest to reduce its carbon footprint. La-Z-Boy’s VPPA will support approximately
                    70,000 MWh of renewable energy per year, from AEP’s principally owned Santa Rita East wind energy center in Irion County, Texas, throughout the term of the agreement. Once fully implemented, La-Z-Boy will receive renewable energy certificates
                    (REC) equivalent to roughly 16 MW of wind power capacity representing more than 90% of La-Z-Boy’s current total annual domestic energy consumption.</p>

                <p><span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is excited to introduce iClean&trade;, its new and innovative stain-repelling fabric. iClean&trade; is a high-performance fabric that incorporates safe, sophisticated chemistry to protect
                    and surround each fiber, repelling spills before they turn into stains. Everyday spills are now protected with iClean&trade;, including coffee, wine, salsa, dirt, chocolate and more.</p>
                <p>So how does it work? iClean&trade; fabrics are completely immersed in a stain resistant solution assuring every single fiber has been treated. This process leaves a concentrated barrier of protection while still keeping the touch soft
                    and luxurious.</p>

                <p><span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is celebrating mothers across the U.S. and Canada today by recognizing the ups &ndash; and downs &ndash; that go along with getting their children back-to-school. By creating a community

                    all their efforts and meticulous preparation, the inevitable happens and the day doesn&rsquo;t go according to plan. Someone sleeps past the alarm, orange juice spills on that new shirt …it&rsquo;s a total #MomFail.</p>
                <p>The bright side of any #MomFail is the enduring sense of camaraderie among parents &ndash; and every mom who has been there, done that. Not to mention all of the funny stories that get shared with friends and family, and passed down through
                    the ages.</p>
