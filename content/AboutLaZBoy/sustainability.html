        <p>At <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>, we understand the impact our operations have on the environment, both locally and globally. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re committed to integrating environmentally sound and sustainable business
            practices into everything we do (see our <a href="https://www.la-z-boy.com/external/Environmental_Policy.pdf" target="_blank">environmental policy</a>). Our goal is to craft high-quality products, while having the least environmental impact.
            We are focused on reducing waste, increasing recycling and energy efficiency, and consuming fewer&nbsp;resources. </p>
        <p>In addition, we work cooperatively with our suppliers to foster compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection through their conformity with our Supplier Code of Conduct and Product Stewardship&nbsp;program.</p>
