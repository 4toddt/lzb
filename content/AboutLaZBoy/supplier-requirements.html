      <ul>
        <li>Use of other construction or material than was used in the previously-approved part or product. </li>
        <li>Production from new or modified tools, dies, molds, patterns, etc. This includes additional or replacement tooling. </li>
        <li>Production following refurbishment or rearrangement of existing tooling or equipment. </li>

Both policies are available from a Purchasing representative.</p>
      <p>Changes to product or process may require re-submission of appropriate product approval samples and documentation (PPAP). </p>
      <h2 id="approval">Supplier selection and approval</h2>
      <p>In order to promote strong, mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers, all new suppliers must first participate in an approval process to help determine if the supplier has the technical, manufacturing, and leadership culture to sustain a long-term relationship with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>. </p>
      <p>Prior to being selected to provide product to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>, all suppliers must be approved. The Supplier Approval Process requires: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A Non-Disclosure Agreement is signed.</li>
        <li>Supplier submits Self-Assessment Questionnaire and Contact List (Forms available on request). </li>

          <li>Safety and Environmental</li>
          <li>Lean Methods / Continuous Improvement Culture</li>

        <li>Following a successful onsite assessment the supplier is presented for approval to the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Procurement Council. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Receiving approval allows the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> purchasing organizations to source from the supplier if other factors (price, delivery, quality etc.) meet expectations. </p>

The scorecard is used as part of the sourcing decision process as well as the primary datum for awarding Supplier Excellence Awards at the end of each fiscal year. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Quality</li>
        <li>Cost</li>
        <li>Delivery & Labelling</li>
        <li>Customer Service</li>
        <li>Innovation</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="awards">Supplier awards</h2>

        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> consumer warranty policy and cover supplier requirements </h3>
      <p>
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> provides a 1 year warranty on the textile or leather from the date the furniture is delivered to the consumer&rsquo;s home. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> expects the textile or leather to meet all Consumer performance expectations when the Cover is produced to the original testing specifications that were present when the Cover was added to the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Line. If the cover fails to perform in a satisfactory manner for the Consumer and the cover is found to not meet the original testing standards, the Cover Supplier will be responsible for all costs associated with the failure. This could include the cost for replacement of the furniture for the Consumer. </p>
      <p>It is important for the Cover Supplier to understand that <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> does not require the return of consumer warranty failure furniture components or the piece of furniture that is being replaced for the consumer. While we do attempt to retrieve consumer warranty components and furniture, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> cannot guarantee that the Company will be able to provide the Cover Supplier with the failed components or furniture for analysis. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> requires the Cover Suppliers to stand behind the warranty costs for all field failures that <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> determines are the result of covers that are not performing to standard. </p>
