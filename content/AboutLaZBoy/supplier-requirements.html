Both policies are available from a Purchasing representative.</p>
      <p>Changes to product or process may require re-submission of appropriate product approval samples and documentation (PPAP). </p>
      <h3>Product Changes, Discontinuance, Recalls or Non-Conformance (for Casegoods and Finished Goods Suppliers)</h3>
      <p>The Supplier is obligated to communicate in writing to LZB any changes, discontinuance, recalls, or non-conformance that could impact the safety, health or environmental performance of a LZB product.</p>
      <p>If the Goods are the subject of a Recall, whether initiated by Supplier, Buyer or a government entity (including the issuance of safety notices), Supplier shall be responsible for all matters and costs associated with the Recall, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p><span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy&rsquo;s </span>cover requirements are some of the most stringent in the industry to ensure our customers will receive their product in a timely fashion and get years of trouble free comfort from it. The requirements in this manual have been developed through years of experience and collaboration with our supplier partners.</p>

      <h3>Performance and Product Compliance Requirements for Fabrics, Leather, Cut and Sew Kits, and Outsourced Upholstered Goods</h3>
      <p>The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> performance requirements for cover are based on either industry published methods or unique <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> developed test methods. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> also ensures that our products meet the regulatory requirements for flammability, heavy metal content, phthalate content, formaldehyde, and flame retardants.

Suppliers will be provided approved color standards for all products that are sourced. The procedures for color approval and color standards are outlined in the following documents:</p>

The specifications and technical information for performing EDI transactions with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> can be found in:</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Delivery</h3>
      <p>On time delivery is important to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> to ensure we can provide our customers with a high level of service. It is the supplier&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain accurate data in their work in progress (WIP) report and to notify <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> of a possible delivery delay. Extra shipping charges may be necessary to expedite late shipments to maintain <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy&rsquo;s </span>level of service to our customers. The procedure for late shipments and air shipments are outlined in the following documents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>CPD-51: Late Shipment Policy</em></li>

      <h3>Product Changes</h3>
      <p>Changes to product sent to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> are sometimes necessary to ensure high quality product, replace discontinued components, or to change manufacturing locations. Any change that may impact the performance or appearance of must be communicated to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> in writing. If changes go into effect without <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy&rsquo;s </span>prior knowledge and approval, the supplier is responsible for all costs incurred to approve the change and replace any unapproved product. The procedure for product change is outlined in the following document:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>CPD-25: Change of Product Procedure</em></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Corrective Actions and Clean Points</h3>
      <p>Quality issues can arise on occasion that require deeper problem solving to correct. The issues require 8D corrective actions to be filled out and performed by the supplier to ensure the issue is properly analyzed and effective corrective actions are taken to prevent reoccurrence. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> will notify the supplier when an issue requires an 8D corrective action to be filled out. The procedure for corrective actions is outlined in the following document:</p>
      <ul>

      <p>After a quality issue is corrected sometimes the clean point needs to be identified so personnel in <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> plants don&rsquo;t need to inspect the product. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> will notify the supplier when a clean point label is necessary. The clean point procedure is outlined in the following document:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>CPD-17: Quality Clean Point Policy</em></li>
      </ul>

New Market covers are selected after supplier&rsquo;s showcase their new developments to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> at their Monroe, Michigan headquarters.</p>
      <p>After the new Market covers are selected, the supplier&rsquo;s must adhere the requirements of testing for Market, shipping schedule for swatching and Market unit yardage, and the necessary sampling yardage requirements.

        <li><em>CPD-47: General Market Milestones</em></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Supplier Scorecard</h3>
      <p>To provide feedback to our suppliers and grade their performance, each quarter our suppliers are sent a scorecard. Suppliers are scored in four areas: quality, delivery, customer service, and innovation. Scorecards are used in the sourcing process for new Market covers, outsource cut and sew kits, and also for awarding higher performing suppliers for their performance. The different areas and scoring criteria is detailed in the following document:</p>

      <h3>Warranty</h3>
      <p><span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> provides our customers a one year warranty on cover from the date the furniture is delivered into the customer&rsquo;s home. If the cover does not perform in a satisfactory manner to our customer and the reason for failure is found to be a cover manufacturing defect, the cover supplier will be responsible for the costs associated with the failure. These costs include parts, labor, freight, and possibly replacement of the furniture. Monthly reports are provided to the supplier and following document details the procedure:</p>
      <ul>
