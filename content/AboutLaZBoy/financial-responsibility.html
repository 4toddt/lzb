        <h2>Advantage of financial strength</h2>
        <p>Our ability to adapt to an ever-changing industry and increasingly competitive marketplace has resulted in our continued success for over 90 years. Since 1927, our commitment to innovation, quality and comfort has never wavered. By reinvesting
            in our brand, building on our strengths, taking calculated risks and developing strategic advantages, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> has positioned itself for long-term financial&nbsp;returns.
        </p>
        <p>A strong brand, solid balance sheet and expansive global supply chain allow us to execute a dual-growth strategy focused on strengthening core offerings, while at the same time expanding our consumer base and developing new areas of growth in
            the digital&nbsp;marketplace.
        </p>
        <h2>Conservative fiscal philosophy</h2>
        <p>Almost a century of experience and a conservative fiscal philosophy have allowed <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> to weather market fluctuations, while continuing to invest in our brand and world-class global supply chain. A
            strong balance sheet and consistent strong cash generation give us flexibility in the dynamic marketplace, allowing us to make strategic acquisitions, strengthen our operations and competitive positioning, and venture into new&nbsp;areas.</p>

        <h3>Consistent returns to shareholders</h3>
        <p>Our capital allocation strategy has been focused on three elements: investing in the business to drive long-term value and returns; paying a consistent dividend; and buying back shares. With our strong cash generation, we have been able to do
            all three over recent&nbsp;years.*</p>
        <p>You may find the company&rsquo;s financial information on the <a href="https://lazboy.gcs-web.com/" target="_blank">Investor Relations</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
        <p>By making prudent investments across the company, the <span style="white-space: nowrap;" class="registered">La-Z-Boy</span> brand continues to evolve, delivering an enhanced customer experience through a combination of online, in store and in-home
            options and&nbsp;services.</p>
        <p class="fine-print">*On March 29, 2019, the company announced its COVID-19 Action Plan, which included suspending its undeclared June quarterly dividend to shareholders and share purchase program in an effort to manage the business to preserve cash and to ensure
            the continued liquidity of the company. As the company&rsquo;s performance continues to recover, we will look to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, once we have evaluated the business recovery for a meaningful&nbsp;period.</p>
