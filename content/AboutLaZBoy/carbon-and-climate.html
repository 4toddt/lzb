        <p>A majority of the Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases we generate are produced through the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, we have implemented a very effective energy management program to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. We are working

        <p>We are committed to reducing our energy consumption, reducing costs, optimizing capital investment for energy efficiency, reducing environmental and greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural&nbsp;resources.

    <p>We continue to utilize on-site generated renewable wood fuels for the generation of steam used in production operations, heating and absorption cooling, and we sell excess wood residuals for further reuse by other industries. Wood fuel from sustainably
        managed forests is a renewable resource that helps reduce our use of fossil fuels, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and also reduces the volume of waste going to a solid waste&nbsp;landfill.</p>
    <p>We have reduced the amount of energy used by our LZB Branded Manufacturing operations by 33% compared with 2007&nbsp;usage.</p>
    <h2>Renewable energy</h2>
    <p>Our Dayton, Tennessee manufacturing facility utilizes a biomass system to heat and cool the facility and provide steam to dry green lumber. This system produces approximately 21 million KW hour equivalent energy units. Our Severn, Maryland
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Furniture <span class="registered">Galleries</span> store utilizes photovoltaic electricity. The company is investigating virtual power purchasing agreements and other applications to diversify
        its electricity sourcing. However, as of Fiscal 2020, we are purchasing more than 99% of our electricity from grid&nbsp;sources.</p>

    <p>We do not currently measure our Scope 3 greenhouse gas&nbsp;emissions.</p>
    <p>We are evaluating methods to capture other sources of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions but believe these are significantly less than those provided above with the exception of transportation-related greenhouse&nbsp;gases.
    </p>
    <p>A majority of our greenhouse gas emission sources are from off-site electricity generation with a lesser extent coming from on-site natural gas consumption. As a result, a majority of our greenhouse gas emission pollutants are carbon dioxide with
        insignificant emissions of nitric oxide and&nbsp;methane.</p>
