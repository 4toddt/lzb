        <h2>Principles of our founders</h2>
        <p>Following the example set by our founders, Mr. Knabusch and Mr. Shoemaker, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is committed to enhancing the quality of life in the communities in which we live and serve through leadership, financial
            contributions and volunteer efforts. Our philanthropic initiatives include the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Foundation, local community involvement, disaster relief, and Ronald McDonald House Charities, and in 2019,
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Incorporated and the
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Foundation made a combined total of donations of more than $2.5&nbsp;million.</p>
        <p>Our employees exemplify this spirit of giving through leadership and volunteer efforts in their own communities, and for numerous non-profit organizations, which include the United Way, Relay for Life, Habitat for Humanity and&nbsp;others.</p>
        <p>“The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Summer of Caring” is a seasonal initiative that encourages and supports employee volunteerism during the summer. The program launched in 2018 and since then, our employees have accumulated
            over 13,000 hours of caring. In 2019, a sister program “The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Season of Caring” was launched at the request of employees who wanted to continue that spirit of volunteerism during the holiday
            season. These programs correspond with the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Corporate Mission Statement and are a great addition to the overall corporate social responsibility initiatives of&nbsp;<span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> made and donated hundreds of thousands of masks to healthcare workers in the communities in which we operate and offered masks to our suppliers for their workforces.
            We also donated recliners to a local hospital for healthcare workers to relax in after grueling shifts. Additionally, the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> Foundation donated money to local Monroe, Michigan-based groups to
            help those in need during the crisis and many of our employees made personal contributions to those impacted by the pandemic. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">La-Z-Boy</span> is also donating $1 million of furniture to frontline healthcare
            workers through our #OneMillionThanks campaign, where we are harnessing the collective spirit and creativity of individuals across the Internet to say thank you to those medical professionals who have worked tirelessly to ensure our safety.
            We know our founders would be proud of our efforts to give back to the communities around us.</p>
