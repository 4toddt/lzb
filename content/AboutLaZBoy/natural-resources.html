        <p>As of Fiscal 2020, our water conservation efforts have reduced the amount of water used by our LZB Branded Manufacturing operations by more than 25,000,000 gallons compared with 2007&nbsp;usage.</p>
        <h2>Land, forests, and biodiversity</h2>
        <p>We have sourcing policies and processes in place (see Wood Sourcing Policy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.la-z-boy.com/Images/npc/AboutLaZBoy/natural-resources/Wood Sourcing Policy.pdf" download>here</a>) to help us ensure we comply with
            the legal sourcing requirements of the Lacey Act and eliminate illegal logging activities. We obtain many of our wood materials and components from suppliers that have implemented sustainable forest management practices or from sustainable
            plantation-grown renewable rubber-wood. We also use many other wood- and fiber-based materials made with recycled or recovered&nbsp;paper. </p>
        <p>The total weight of wood fiber purchased for Fiscal 2020 was approximately 60,825 metric tons. This includes engineered wood, lumber/hardwoods and panel board.</p>
